- Thesis: “No” to all five prompts: traditional theism need not imply biblical literalism/creationism; science and (well-defined) religion need not conflict; God-of-the-gaps is not required; the Problem of Evil isn’t decisively atheistic; eternal life isn’t “hell for wrong dogma.”
- Core case: Across two millennia, major Jewish and Christian thinkers (e.g., Origen, Augustine, Maimonides, Calvin, Galileo, Temple, Lewis, modern scholars) reject literalist readings of Genesis and anthropomorphic views of God, stressing that Scripture teaches salvation, not science, and often speaks figuratively.
- Science–faith: Evolution and natural law can be understood as expressions of divine providence; literalism is a modern aberration, not historic orthodoxy. Both anti-religious polemics and creationist readings commit category errors by treating theological texts as scientific treatises.
- Conclusion: “Old-school” theism is compatible with non-literal interpretation and scientific inquiry; equating theism with creationism or anti-science is a strawman.
- Core question: What, if anything, grounds or transcends the empirically observable universe? Scientific progress intensifies, not removes, this question.
- Science: a falsification-based method limited to intersubjective, testable claims; it is neutral on unfalsifiable metaphysics. Qualia exemplify intrinsic limits.
- Reductionism points toward an ultimate, elegant principle—conceptually close to a non-anthropomorphic, transcendent God.
- Distinguish religions: tribal-dogmatic (often anti-scientific) vs experiential-transformative (science-compatible, focused on lived transformation).
- Religious reasoning as iterative model-building: subjective experience plus rational constraints and coherence tests; revelation is critically evaluated.
- Implicit God-definition: the transcendent ground of lawfulness and consciousness and the loving Presence in religious experience—one parsimonious source of both.
- Objections addressed: God needn’t be complex; first-cause requires transcendence; evil as “necessary” for life/agency (“multiversal mercy” reframes suffering).
- Eschatology reimagined: “eternal life” as convergence to stable, altruistic consciousness; judgment centers on enacted love (Mt 25). Conclusion: non-fundamentalist theism can complement science; “God is love.”

This text aims to be a very basic introduction to the relationship between science, reason, and religion. It's clearly very limited in all sorts of ways but I think it provides a kind of bare minimum to have an at least not totally uninformed opinion. I hasten to note it's not at any kind of academic level, but given what still seems to be the typical quality of public/online debate, it might have some value. The two primary intended audiences are people within a religious tradition worried about feeling pressure to believe irrational things and atheists critical of religion who may want to test their own point of view or assumptions about religion. There's maybe also a little bit of a connection to the more general delineation problem of science.
The main questions the text aims to address are:
    Do "proper", traditional, old-school theistic views imply biblical literalism and creationism?
    Does (well-defined) science contradict (well-defined) religion?
    Does scientific progress lead to an ever-reducing God of the Gaps?
    Is the Problem of Evil/Suffering really a knock-down argument for atheism?
    Is the "proper", traditional, old-school theistic concept of Eternal Life the idea that God sends people to hell for not believing the right religious dogma? 
It's maybe unsurprising I'm going to argue for "no" in all cases, but I hope the arguments and references could be helpful. Note this isn't exactly in defense of religion; it's more in opposition to simplistic anti-religious beliefs.
First, kill the strawman
To start off with, the references below are intended to demonstrate that there's a kind of theism worth thinking about at all. Two points about the sources: First, these aren't sources that are easily dismissed as "not really religious"; after all, they include founding figures of the early Church, famous historical figures, popular writers and mainstream theologians including a pope. Second, some of the references go back more than a millennium before Darwin, so the strongly and perhaps surprisingly un-creationist ideas aren't just examples of backpedaling in the face of scientific successes.
    Origen Adamantius (lived ca. 185-254), Philocalia. "What man of intelligence, I ask, will consider that the first and second and third day, in which there are said to be both morning and evening, existed without sun and moon and stars, while the first day was even without a heaven? And who could be found so silly as to believe that God, after the manner of a farmer 'planted trees in a paradise eastward in Eden'... I do not think anyone will doubt that these are figurative expressions which indicate certain mysteries through a semblance of history."
    Saint Augustine (408), De Genesi ad litteram. "With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures. In short, it must be said that our authors knew the truth about the nature of the skies, but it was not the intention of the Spirit of God, who spoke through them, to teach men anything that would not be of use to them for their salvation. [...] Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field in which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although 'they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.'"
    St. John of Damascus (676 - 749), An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith. "In our case, thoughtfulness, and wisdom, and counsel come to pass and go away as states of being. Not so in the case of God: for with Him there is no happening or ceasing to be: for He is invariable and unchangeable: and it would not be right to speak of contingency in connection with Him. For goodness is concomitant with essence. He who longs always after God, he seeth Him: for God is in all things. Existing things are dependent on that which is, and nothing can be unless it is in that which is. God then is mingled with everything, maintaining their nature: and in His holy flesh the God-Word is made one in subsistence and is mixed with our nature, yet without confusion. We speak of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the mind of Christ, the Spirit of the Lord, the very Lord, the Spirit of adoption, of truth, of liberty, of wisdom (for He is the creator of all these): filling all things with essence, maintaining all things, filling the universe with essence, while yet the universe is not the measure of His power. [...] For He does not belong to the class of existing things: not that He has no existence, but that He is above all existing things, nay even above existence itself. For if all forms of knowledge have to do with what exists, assuredly that which is above knowledge must certainly be also above essence: and, conversely, that which is above essence will also be above knowledge."
    Saadia Gaon (933), The Book of Beliefs and Opinions. "Apropos of [the category of] action, let me say that, even though we denominate the Creator 'Maker' and 'Agent,' the meaning that we attribute to these terms must not be construed in a corporeal sense. [...] When, therefore, we find the Scriptures, in speaking of some of the works of God, make mention of an act and its opposite, it must all be reduced to the fact that, when God creates anything, He brings it into being without actually taking it in hand or coming in contact with it. The Scriptures do, indeed, characterize the positive and negative acts of creation by saying: And God made (Gen. 1:7), And He rested (Gen. 2:2). However, just as the And He made was effected without motion or exertion, consisting only of the production of the thing created, so undoubtedly, when it is said And He rested, it was not relaxation from any kind of motion of exercise."
    Maimonides (around 1175), Mishneh Torah. "It has been stated in Scripture that God has no physical form, as it is written, '...that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath: there is none other'. A physical body cannot be in two places at once. It is also written, '...for you saw no manner of form', and, 'To whom then will you compare Me, that I should be his equal?' - had God had a body it would have been similar to other bodies. If so, what does the Torah mean when it says things like, 'under His feet' (Exodus 31:18), 'written with the finger of God' (ibid), 'the hand of the Lord' (Exodus 9:3), 'the eyes of the Lord' (Genesis 38:7), 'the ears of the Lord' (Numbers 11:1), et cetera? These phrases are in line with the level of understanding of people, who can only comprehend physical existence, and the Torah speaks in terms that we can understand. All examples of this nature are merely attributory. For example, when it says, 'If I whet My glittering sword' - does God really have a sword and does He really kill with one?! Such phrases are figurative. Evidence for this is that one Prophet saw God as wearing garments as white as snow, whereas another Prophet saw God as wearing crimsoned garments from Bozrah. Moses our Teacher himself saw, at the time of the splitting of the Red Sea, God as a war-waging warrior, but at Sinai as a cantor to show him the order of prayer. This shows that God has no form or shape [because He appears different to different people]. God's appearance varies according to each prophetic vision and what it contains. It is beyond Man's intellect to investigate or comprehend [the nature of] God's existence, as it is written, 'Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the purpose of the Almighty?'"
    The Zohar (13th century). "Now the narratives of the Torah are its garments. He who thinks that these garments are the Torah itself deserves to perish and have no share in the world to come. Wo unto the fools who look no further when they see an elegant robe! More valuable than the garment is the body which carries it, and more valuable even than that is the soul which animates the body. Fools see only the garment of the Torah, the more intelligent see the body, the wise see the soul, its proper being, and in the Messianic time the 'upper soul' of the Torah will stand revealed."
    John Calvin (1554), Commentary on Genesis. "I have said, that Moses does not here subtilely descant, as a philosopher, on the secrets of nature, as may be seen in these words... Moses makes two great luminaries; but astronomers prove, by conclusive reasons, that the star of Saturn, which, on account of its great distance, appears the least of all, is greater than the moon. Here lies the difference: Moses wrote in the popular style things which, without instruction, all ordinary persons, endued with common sense, are able to understand; but astronomers investigate with great labor whatever the sagacity of the human mind can comprehend. Nevertheless, this study is not to be reprobated, nor this science to be condemned, because some frantic persons are wont boldly to reject whatever is unknown to them. For astronomy is not only pleasant, but also very useful to be known: it cannot be denied that this art unfolds the admirable wisdom of God."
    Galileo Galilei (1615), Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina. "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use and by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them. I would say here something that was heard from an ecclesiastic of the most eminent degree: 'That the intention of the Holy Ghost is to teach us how one goes to heaven, not how heaven goes.'"
    Robert Chambers (1844). "If there is a choice between special creation and the operation of general laws instituted by the creator, I would say the latter is greatly preferable as it implies a far grander view of the divine power and dignity than the other."
    Frederick Temple, Bishop of Exeter (1884), The relations between religion and science. "He did not make the things, we may say; no, but He made them make themselves. And surely this rather adds than withdraws force from the great argument. It seems in itself something more majestic, something more befitting Him to Whom a thousand years are as one day and one day as a thousand years, thus to impress His Will once for all on His creation, and provide for all its countless variety by this one original impress, than by special acts of creation to be perpetually modifying what He had previously made. It has often been objected to Paley's argument, as I remarked before, that it represents the Almighty rather as an artificer than a creator, a workman dealing with somewhat intractable materials and showing marvellous skill in overcoming difficulties rather than a beneficent Being making all things in accordance with the purposes of His love. But this objection disappears when we put the argument into the shape which the doctrine of Evolution demands and look on the Almighty as creating the original elements of matter, determining their number and their properties, creating the law of gravitation whereby as seems probable the worlds have been formed, creating the various laws of chemical and physical action, by which inorganic substances have been combined, creating above all the law of life, the mysterious law which plainly contains such wonderful possibilities within itself, and thus providing for the ultimate development of all the many wonders of nature. What conception of foresight and purpose can rise above that which imagines all history gathered as it were into one original creative act from which the infinite variety of the Universe has come and more is coming even yet? [...] Science will continue its progress, and as the thoughts of men become clearer it will be perpetually more plainly seen that nothing in Revelation really interferes with that progress. It will be seen that devout believers can observe, can cross-question nature, can look for uniformity and find it, with as keen an eye, with as active an imagination, with as sure a reasoning, as those who deny entirely all possibility of miracles and reject all Revelation on that account. The belief that God can work miracles and has worked them, has never yet obstructed the path of a single student of Science; nor has any student who repudiated that belief found any aid in his study from that repudiation. The rush of Science of late years has for the time made many men fancy that Science is everything; and believers in Revelation have helped this fancy by insisting on their part that Revelation is everything; but such waves of opinion, resting really on feeling, are sure to pass away, and scientific men will learn that there are other kinds of knowledge besides scientific knowledge, as believers are already learning that God teaches us by other methods besides the method of Revelation."
    Pope Leo XIII (1893), Providentissimus Deus 18. "No real disagreement can exist between the theologian and the scientist provided each keeps within his own limits. ... If nevertheless there is a disagreement ... it should be remembered that the sacred writers, or more truly 'the Spirit of God who spoke through them, did not wish to teach men such truths (as the inner structure of visible objects) which do not help anyone to salvation'; and that, for this reason, rather than trying to provide a scientific exposition of nature, they sometimes describe and treat these matters either in a somewhat figurative language or as the common manner of speech those times required, and indeed still requires nowadays in everyday life, even amongst most learned people."
    C. S. Lewis (1952), Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis. "It is Christ Himself, not the Bible, who is the true Word of God. The Bible, read in the right spirit and with the guidance of good teachers will bring us to Him. When it becomes really necessary (i.e. for our spiritual life, not for controversy or curiosity) to know whether a particular passage is rightly translated or is Myth (but of course Myth specially chosen by God from among countless Myths to carry a spiritual truth) or history, we shall no doubt be guided to the right answer. But we must not use the Bible (our ancestors too often did) as a sort of Encyclopedia out of which texts (isolated from their context and read without attention to the whole nature and purport of the books in which they occur) can be taken for use as weapons. My own position is not Fundamentalist, if Fundamentalism means accepting as a point of faith at the outset the proposition 'Every statement in the Bible is completely true in the literal, historical sense'. That would break down at once on the parables. All the same commonsense and general understanding of literary kinds which would forbid anyone to take the parables as historical statements, carried a very little further, would force us to distinguish between (1.) Books like Acts or the account of David's reign, which are everywhere dovetailed into a known history, geography, and genealogies, (2.) Books like Esther, or Jonah or Job which deal with otherwise unknown characters living in unspecified periods, and pretty well proclaim themselves to be sacred fiction."
    Fritz Rothschild (1971), Truth and Metaphor in the Bible. "The view that the Bible contains God's message to man has led to ever new interpretations, since it constantly forced believing readers of the Bible to reconcile the words of the sacred text with whatever they held to be true on the basis of their own experience, the canons of logic, contemporary science, and their moral insights. [...] The traditionalist will always feel called upon to interpret the text so that it reflects not ancient error but the highest standards of trustworthy knowledge and insight of his own time. If we believe that God's message is to be found in Scripture, we can expect that basic motifs, metaphors and paradigmatic tales contain guidance ('Torah') for all ages, and it becomes our duty to delve into their implications with reverence and seriousness. On the same assumption, however, the timeless message can never be read through the spectacles of our great-grandparents. It becomes our duty and challenge to do what previous generations have done: to focus upon the sacred text the fullest light of knowledge at our disposal."
    R. J. Coleman (1975), Biblical Inerrancy: Are We Going Anywhere? On the history of belief in Bibilical Inerrancy. "The question of biblical inerrancy is remarkably the same now as it was nearly a century ago. Yet it is not the black and white issue commonly conjured up in the minds of most people; namely, one side claiming the Bible contains no discrepancies or inconsistencies whatsoever, with the other side claiming the Scriptures are riddled with error. On the contrary, even Warfield and Hodge conceded that the biblical writers were at times "dependent for their information upon sources and methods in themselves fallible, their personal knowledge and judgment were in many matters hesitating and defective or even wrong." They also recognized that 'inspiration does not suppose that the words and phrases written under its influence are the best possible to express the truth, but only that they are an adequate expression of the truth. Other words and phrases might furnish a clearer, more exact, and therefore better expression... ' These two concessions in themselves permit an unexpected latitude in the kind and number of errors possibly found in Scripture."
    Steven Katz (1978), in God and the Astronomers, R. Jastrow, pp. 147-163. "Theological concern with evolution tends to be derived from a literalist reading of Genesis. As I have tried to show, in Jewish religious thought Genesis is not regarded as meant for a literal reading, and Jewish tradition has not usually read it so. [...] The basis for disagreement is not the conflict of evolution with a literal reading of Genesis, but rather the evolutionist's denial of teleology, i.e. the denial of purpose in and through nature, and purposeful movement in and through history, toward some end or goal. While evolution argues for the random, purposeless nature of natural selection, this argument only describes specific events, whether mutations or reproductions, within history and nature. It does not offer evidence for or against the purposeful ordering of nature and history as wholes. As the medievals, for example, Thomas Aquinas in his Five-Fold Way, were wrong when they argued that the existence of a "First Cause" could be proven inductively as a consequence of observing a chain of causation within nature and history, because the observance of a cause in nature or history does not prove there is a cause of nature or history, so, too, modern men, who deny a cause of nature because of the randomness of natural selection, make the same error of logic, but in the reverse direction."
    Conrad Hyers (1982), Biblical Literalism: Constricting the Cosmic Dance. See also: The Meaning of Creation and Dinosaur Religion: On Interpreting and Misinterpreting the Creation Texts. "The critical question in the creation account of Genesis 1 was polytheism versus monotheism. _That_ was the burning issue of the day, not some issue which certain Americans 2,500 years later in the midst of the scientific age might imagine that it was. [...] Read through the eyes of the people who wrote it, Genesis 1 would seem very different from the way most people today would tend to read it--including evolutionists who may dismiss it as a pre-scientific account of origins, and creationists who may try to defend it as the true science and literal history of origins. [...] In the light of this historical context it becomes clearer what Genesis 1 is undertaking and accomplishing: a radical and sweeping affirmation of monotheism vis-`a-vis polytheism, syncretism and idolatry. Each day takes on two principal categories of divinity in the pantheons of the day, and declares that these are not gods at all, but creatures--creations of the one true God who is the only one, without a second or third. Each day dismisses an additional cluster of deities, arranged in a cosmological and symmetrical order. [...] The issue was idolatry, not science; syncretism, not natural history; theology, not chronology; affirmations of faith in one transcendent God, not creationist or evolutionist theories of origin. Attempting to be loyal to the Bible by turning the creation accounts into a kind of science or history is like trying to be loyal to the teachings of Jesus by arguing that the parables are actual historical events, and only reliable and trustworthy when taken literally as such."
    Lasor, Hubbard, and Bush (1996), Old Testament Survey, p. 72. "Literary device also is found in the names used. The correspondence of the name with the person's function or role is striking in several instances. Adam means 'mankind' and Eve is '(she who gives) life.' Surely, when an author of a story names the principal characters Mankind and Life, something is conveyed about the degree of literalness intended! Similarly Cain means 'forger (of metals)'; Enoch is connected with 'dedication, consecration' (4:17; 5:18); Jubal with horn and trumpet (4:21); while Cain, condemned to be a nad, a 'wanderer,' goes to live in the land of Nod, a name transparently derived from the same Hebrew root, thus the land of wandering! This suggests that the author is writing as an artist, a storyteller, who uses literary device and artifice. One must endeavor to distinguish what he intends to teach from the literary means employed."
    K. Lewis (1997), On the Heresy of Literalism. "The history of American Christianity has been dominated by revivalism and Protestant evangelicalism, particularly in the South. As result, countless earnest Christians have come to rest in the assumption that the only way the truth of the Bible can be maintained is by claiming it to be literal truth. This is the belief that Scripture should be read as literally as possible in every respect, and especially wherever not to do so would seem to deny the power of God to operate apart from the laws of nature. Latter-day appeals to "Inerrancy" as a fighting principle insist upon this literalism, often appearing to bait both skeptical and more traditional contemporary minds. But is this heresy? In 1980 Episcopalian pastoral theologian, Urban T. Holmes observed flatly that "literalism is a modern heresy-perhaps the only heresy invented in modern times." But he did not proceed to argue the case. No one has. Heresy is traditionally understood to emerge within a community of faith when a legitimate point of belief is over-emphasized to the neglect of other equally legitimate, complementing, occasionally countering points of belief needed to make up the delicate balance of doctrines in an "orthodox" rule of faith. Heresy emerges as a truncating distortion of the faith. From the earliest times, Christian heresies have inflicted damage from within upon the Church's theologically ordered system of faith, constructed from the biblical testimony and crystallized in concise credal formulae. The heresy of literalism as such is a modern, post-scientific phenomenon."
    Revd Dr Ernest Lucas (2007), Faraday Paper 11. "Scientists and engineers, often with little theological training, began to use biblical passages as a source of scientific information about the age of the earth and the origins of biological diversity, a different way of understanding the Bible from that practised in mainstream theology. One result is that today about half the population of the USA, a world leader in science and technology, adopts this modernist stance in their interpretation of Genesis, leading to predictable conflicts with the scientific community. Ironically, some anti-religious scientists also share the creationists' modernist stance towards interpreting Genesis. This paper argues that both sides in this sterile debate base their positions on a mishandling of the Hebrew narratives, failing to use standard methods of biblical interpretation which have been well established since the time of Augustine and the early Church Fathers."
So, from the early beginnings of the church up to the work of present-day theologians, prominent religious leaders and theologians explicitly, sometimes quite harshly, rejected the stereotypical Fundamentalist religious attitude, and argued for using the best available level of scientific knowledge and philosophical sophistication to test religious beliefs. Origen, Augustine, Saadia Gaon, Galileo and Calvin rejected a literal, pseudoscientific reading of the Genesis stories long before modern evolution-versus-creationism debates. The point I'd like to drive home is that this very traditional kind of theism sits very awkwardly with claims that theism / "real theism" is necessarily linked to creationism or anti-scientific thinking in general.
The Common Metaphysical Question
There's a difficult question that religion has to deal with, but so do naturalism, atheism, agnosticism, theism and any other religious and metaphysical stances: What lies behind the empirically observable universe? "Lies behind" has multiple senses here: "what else is there?", "on what does it depend?", "what is it about?" Let the empirically observable universe include cosmological and evolutionary processes, all possible empirical information, and the best possible scientific models based on objective observation and logical inference. The progress of science doesn't create a God-of-the-gaps by making this question go away; in contrast, the more scientific knowledge, the more the question is about. (Note that "metaphysical" doesn't refer to some kind of "supernatural physics" but to questions concerning all of existence and reality, or questions at a higher level of abstraction than, or at the level of the assumptions of, empirical science; for instance, the question whether such questions exist meaningfully.) Heidegger's fundamental question of metaphysics was "why are there beings at all instead of nothing", and regardless of what his beliefs about the answer turned out to be, he did clearly raise the question of what Being an sich is, as a separate kind of question from what the characteristics of beings, or laws governing beings, are. This "Common Metaphysical Question" arises very naturally: we observe and wonder: could there be things we aren't seeing? Do things exist we don't or even can't observe via objective, replicable methods? Could they be important nevertheless? What relationship is there between observable reality and all of reality?
We clearly have a strong tendency to ask this kind of question, regardless of our particular belief system, despite the fact that it's a very strange question, far outside our natural domain of finding things to eat, avoiding physical dangers, and so on. One response to this tension is to say that such questions therefore go beyond the limits of our reason and the best thing to do would be to not give them any attention. But our evolved cognitive capacities have let us understand far more about reality than the local natural environment that selected them. As said by physicist J. D. Barrow, "There are some who say that just because we use our minds to appreciate the order and complexity of the Universe around us that there is nothing more to that order than what is imposed by the human mind. That is a serious misjudgement. Were it true then we would expect to find our greatest and most reliable understanding of the world in the everyday events for which millions of years of natural selection have sharpened our wits and prepared our senses. And when we look towards the outer space of galaxies and black holes, or into the inner space of quarks and electrons, we should expect to find few resonances between our minds and the ways of these worlds. Natural selection requires no understanding of quarks and black holes for our survival and multiplication. And yet, we find these expectations turned upon their heads. The most precise and reliable knowledge we have about anything in the Universe is of events in a binary star system more than 3000 light years from our planet and in the sub-atomic world of electrons and light rays, where it is accurate to better than nine decimal places." So the fact that we can speculatively trace the capacity to ask the religious question back to things like tigers hiding in the jungle doesn't logically imply that extending the use of that capacity is necessarily nothing but a malfunction. The problem does remain, however - we have to find appropriate ways to critically evaluate our answers to the question.
It may be worth noting that scientists do not uniformly consider any answer to the question other than "nothing", or any response beyond "the question is nonsense", to be opposed to science. Some quotes illustrating this point follow, which of course don't imply any specific kind of religiosity on the part of the quoted; the argument here is only that the type of metaphysical questions and arguments underlying a theistic worldview are apparently not always viewed as not worth attention or as something to be effectively considered taboo. The quotes also provide some interesting responses to the Common Metaphysical Question - perhaps more interesting responses than the "un-ask the question" stance. It's also interesting to see that these responses aren't far away from the very traditional theistic thinking we saw above.
    Gottfried Leibniz, Memoir for Enlightened Persons of Good Intention (1690), Discourse on Metaphysics (1686) and Dialogue (1677). "As for me, I put forward the great principle of metaphysics as well as of morality, that the world is governed by the most perfect intelligence which is possible, which means that one must consider it as a universal monarchy whose head is all-powerful and sovereignly wise, and whose subjects are all minds, that is, substances capable of relations or society with God; and that all the rest is only the instrument of the glory of God and of the felicity of minds, and that as a result the entire universe is made for minds. [...] Now it is clear, first of all, that the created substances depend on God, who preserves them and indeed even produces them continually by a kind of emanation, as we produce our thoughts. [...] When God calculates and thinks things through, the world is made."
    Albert Einstein, On Science and Religion (1940), letter to Maurice Solovine (1952), cablegram reply to Rabbi Herbert Goldstein (referenced in Schilpp (1988); credit for finding the reference to Arnold V. Lesikar). "I am not a positivist. Positivism states that what cannot be observed does not exist. This conception is scientifically indefensible, for it is impossible to make valid affirmations of what people 'can' or 'cannot' observe. One would have to say 'only what we observe exists,' which is obviously false.' [...] You find it strange that I consider the comprehensibility of the world (to the extent that we are authorized to speak of such a comprehensibility) as a miracle or an eternal mystery. Well a priori one should expect a chaotic world which cannot be grasped by the mind in anyway. One could (yes one should) expect the world to be subjected to law only to the extent that we order it through our intelligence. Ordering of this kind would be like the alphabetical ordering of the words of a language. By contrast, the kind of order created by Newton's theory of gravitation, for instance, is wholly different. Even if the axioms of the theory are proposed by man, the success of such a project presupposes a high degree of ordering of the objective world, and this could not be expected a priori. That is the "miracle" which is being constantly re-enforced as our knowledge expands. [...] I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."
    Edmund Husserl, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1954). Another non-atheistic and non-Fundamentalist view similar to Spinoza's God. "A superior survey of the world must be launched, unfettered by myth and the whole tradition: universal knowledge, absolutely free from prejudice, of the world and man, ultimately recognizing in the world its inherent reason and teleology and its highest principle, God."
    Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time (1990). Note how Leibniz' or St. John of Damascus' concept of an "emanating" rather than "setting-up" Creator could be a potential answer to his question about a place for a creator even in a universe without beginning or end. "So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundaries or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator? [...] Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? [...] Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and, if so, does he have any other effect on the universe? And who created him?"
    John D. Barrow again. "We see now how it is possible for a Universe that displays unending complexity and exquisite structure to be governed by a few simple laws - perhaps just one law - that are symmetrical and intelligible, laws which govern the most remarkable things in our Universe - populations of elementary "particles" that are everywhere perfectly identical. It is to this simple and beautiful world behind the appearances, where the lawfulness of Nature is most elegantly and completely revealed, that physicists look to find the hallmark of the Universe. Everyone else looks at the outcomes of these laws. The outcomes are often complicated, hard to understand, and of great significance - they even include ourselves - but the true simplicity and symmetry of the Universe is to be found in the things that are not seen. Most remarkable of all, we find that there are mathematical equations, little squiggles on pieces of paper, that tell us how whole Universes behave. For there is a logic larger than Universes that is the more surprising because we can understand a meaningful part of it and thereby share in its appreciation."
    Ken Miller, Finding Darwin's God (2000). Ken Miller has a great talk, arguing as a theist against intelligent design, here. "Each of the great Western monotheistic traditions sees God as truth, love, and knowledge. This should mean that each and every increase in our understanding of the natural world is a step toward God and not, as many people assume, a step away. If faith and reason are both gifts from God, then they should play complementary, not conflicting, roles in our struggle to understand the world around us. As a scientist and as a Christian, that is exactly what I believe. True knowledge comes only from a combination of faith and reason. As more than one scientist has said, the truly remarkable thing about the world is that it actually does make sense. The parts fit, the molecules interact, the darn thing works. To people of faith, what evolution says is that nature is complete. Their God fashioned a material world in which truly free and independent beings could evolve. He got it right the very first time."
    Martin Rees: "Let me say that I don't see any conflict between science and religion. I go to church as many other scientists do. I share with most religious people a sense of mystery and wonder at the universe and I want to participate in religious ritual and practices because they're something that all humans can share."
So, it doesn't seem true that significant scientific expertise automatically implies a philosophically materialist belief system or a rejection of the value of asking the Common Metaphysical Question. In contrast, it could be argued that meaningfully exploring the Common Metaphysical Question requires a good understanding of both science and religion, since the question sits on the edge of both domains.
Science versus religion
This section is about the relationship - conflict? - between science and religion. So, first off, to start defining terms: What's science? I'd describe it as a system of generating reliable beliefs, with at its core a method of evaluating claims. The method is usually described in terms of falsification: for any scientific claim, independent critics must attempt to demonstrate that it is false, and continued failure to falsify a claim means the claim is strong. It must however be possible to falsify the claim if it were false: coming up with an unfalsifiable claim, a claim that we cannot adequately test, puts you outside the scientific method. In the scientific context, falsifying evidence must be provided via objective (i.e., intersubjective - it can't be something only you can observe) and replicable observations or experiments. For most of the points made in this text however, only the general demand for some kind of objective evidence is critical. Falsified claims are either replaced or adapted to deal with the criticism, and so progress is made: claims become able to withstand more and more criticism. The method leads to and defines a body of results - the scientific literature - and is applied by a group of professionals in a social setting - the scientific community. However, science is not an ideology or a total world view. No matter how focused a broader world view like ideological naturalism or logical positivism is on science, it itself is not scientific: it does not apply the scientific method, in particular not to itself as a whole (note that many claims associated with naturalism - e.g. that science is extremely useful and important - can be tested, but the truth of such claims are not at all specific evidence for naturalism being uniquely reasonable; other worldviews are perfectly compatible with such claims). To put it even more strongly, such a worldview is not only not scientific - being scientific is simply not a characteristic of worldviews in general - but either inconsistent or unjustified by its own principles. This realization led to, for instance, Popperian ideas about metascience displacing positivist attempts at expanding science into a worldview.
Science as it exists in reality is of course not perfect, and the scientific process is not completed, and perhaps it never will be. But however much we criticize scientific culture, we have to consider what we imagine might replace it. OK, so academia is corrupt to its core of grants, feudal structures, and academic publishing - do we therefore just place our trust in some wise-sounding authority figure's opinion? Do we stop caring about providing evidence for statements? Do we replace attempts to quantify certainty with how intuitively convincing a story sounds?
But the sociology of science, however interesting and important, isn't relevant to the argument I hope to make here: We can assume that the science I'm talking about is absolutely, 100% ideal. The point is that even given an ideal state of science, there are logical, inherent limitations to where we can apply this tool, however powerful it is. Science by definition applies to that part of reality about which scientifically falsifiable claims can be made, i.e. empirical reality. Recall that the Common Metaphysical Question is: what else is there? The scientific method makes no claim about empirical reality being all of reality. Nothing about the fact that science exists, or any logical implications of the rules developed to do it, or the fact that the rules work well in their context implies that unfalsifiable statements are untrue or meaningless: they are simply outside science. The scientific method cannot be applied to them. All this means is that we need to involve other grounds for justification and criticism - or simply give up. Either way, pure science remains neutral on the matter.
The prime example of a phenomenon that is inherently outside the limits of empirical science is the purely subjective component of experience, or qualia. No matter how well we understand the brain and neural information processing, no matter how many fascinating data we can gather concerning what is observable about the mind, we cannot objectively observe that purely subjective aspect of experience: there is a perfect symmetry involved that renders it invisible to science. Yet the inherent subjectivity of our consciousness does exist, and is maybe the most important factor in our lives. This is at least highly remarkable. One response to this would be to obfuscate everything about the problem of qualia that doesn't fit a certain worldview, which therefore fails to incorporate an essential aspect of reality.
A point where the boundaries between science and religion could be seen to start converging is the rising hierarchy of explanations that science tends to follow, the elegant process with the maybe slightly unfortunate label of "reductionism". Explanations don't become more and more complex, isolated and particular, but more and more abstract, symmetrical and elegant; while still being applicable to a wide range of specific cases. The idea of an Ultimate Principle at the top of this hierarchy of explanations is conceptually close to the non-physical, transcendent God of real-life theism (as opposed to an anthropomorphic "magical engineer" style designer). The God of science could be defined as the convergence of causality via decomposition. There would still be a non-scientific step from inferring such a Principle and finding it to be scientifically satisfying, to finding it spiritually satisfying - would or could you worship it? Could it somehow be associated with feelings of love and beauty? Could one say that any person or state exhibits the Principle more "purely" than anything else in the universe? Nevertheless, a non-anthropomorphic form of theism seems a quite natural point to which the scientific process alone might lead, and at least a complementary part of a broader worldview.
Alternatively, one could think there's an inherent conflict between the scepticism and truth-seeking of science and the false confidence and delusionality of religion. I think anyone who's spent time in religious environments has had negative experiences in line with the latter depiction. In contrast, for example, the writer Isaac Bashevis Singer said "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters." And indeed, religious doubt surely exists just as much as religious fanaticism. This illustrates the problem with generalizations about religion: They become stereotypes that ignore some critical part of the complexity. I'd like to suggest, as a very basic model of religious variation, that there are two distinct and opposing kinds of religion: let's label them "tribal-dogmatic" and "experiential-transformative". If these styles of religious were to be different enough from each other, then what's true for one kind may have no implications for the other. In this model, the tribal style treats God as a thing in the universe, with definite characteristics and causal relationships with other objects in the universe. In contrast, the experiential style treats God as the power behind a transformative experience, considered to be unexpressable at least to a very large extent, and to transcend physical reality. The experiential God is believed to act "from within" the fabric of reality itself in some way. The two types of religion are described for example by Martin Buber in I and Thou as follows. "The eternal Thou can by its nature not become It; for by its nature it cannot be established in measure and bounds, not even in the measure of the immeasurable, or the bounds of boundless being; for by its nature it cannot be understood as a sum of quantities, not even as an infinite sum of quantities raised to a transcendental level; for it can be found neither in nor out of the world; for it cannot be experienced, or thought; for we miss Him, Him who is, if we say 'I believe, that He is' - 'He' is also a metaphor, but 'Thou' is not. [...] Man desires to possess God; he desires a continuity in space and time of possession of God. He is not content with the inexpressible confirmation of meaning, but wants to see this confirmation stretched out as something that can be continually taken up and handled, a continuum unbroken in space and time that insures his life at every point and every moment."
The tribal-dogmatic style is, I assume, amply-known from e.g. American culture wars (although in reality most believers are presumably somewhere on a continuum between the two types) or various kinds of violent religious extremism. This style, in its most extreme form, will indeed require a shared blind acceptance of some source of authority, regardless of reason. However, nothing in the other, experiential-transformative style obligates Christians to, for instance, treat creation myths as literal truths about physical reality. In general, insistence that Christians "must" believe certain things that have no justification seems to be based on wanting to treat all religion as the tribal-dogmatic type. Since the criticisms of the tribal-dogmatic style will be well-known and I'll return to some of the problems associated with it later, I'd like to present some points that focus on implications of the experiential-transformative perspective.
    Religious faith can't be reduced to solely mean 'belief without proof'. 'To have faith' in at least one religious perspective refers to an engagement with the transformative, relational process of religion; a decision to be open to changes that might occur, an affinity to what is perceived as the driving force behind it, and convictions that may involve some form of personal, subjectively accessible evidence.
    Russell's teapot, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, invisible pink unicorns and so on have been used to criticize religious faith. Such examples provide excellent thought experiments that show that the lack of disproof of something isn't proof it exists; this is a perfectly valid logical point. However, (1) they are not associated with the cross-cultural transformative experience of religion, (2) they are presented as objects in the universe, and (3) they are by design characterized by specific absurd or contradictory combinations of characteristics that do violate empirical knowledge - we know where teapots come from, and we know that that makes it implausible for one to float around Jupiter. Concerning the second mismatch between the Flying Teapot and God, a possibly useful analogy for how the experiential God would "exist" is the way logical or mathematical truths "exist": they do not exist as physical objects; they are true independent of location; nothing in the physical universe can violate them; they cannot die or decay; they are discovered using the mind, and considered to have inherent beauty and value. So, where the Flying Teapot analogies might overstep into assuming their absurdity characterizes anything non-observable, it's worth considering that we already have an accepted kind of non-empirical existence that isn't inherently absurd.
    Experiential-transformative religion is not aimed at explaining processes or predicting events in the empirical world. It provides different kinds of benefits: it adds a unique kind of meaning to the observable universe; it changes how people live their lives; it opens up a broader perception of reality; it cultivates ideals and motivations that would not arise from exclusively within-science considerations; it provides hints of something truly worth worshipping and adapting to.
So while some forms of religion are anti-scientific, others are simply concerned with different aspects of reality, or different relationships with reality than that of explanation. This latter style fits to some extent with Gould's well-known non-overlapping magisteria approach, or NOMA. Criticism of NOMA have been aimed at demanding to know the precise limits of the domains, which of course is a very weak counterargument: perhaps the domains should be defined by family resemblance, perhaps the line may be blurred, and perhaps the characteristic of empirical falsification provides sufficient delineation. These are details to be worked out, and perhaps to let evolve over time, not fatal flaws of the approach. I'm more critical of the emphasis on the role of making authoritative statements - is that really the aim of religion? Further, a more fundamental criticism is that the relationship between science and religion, depending on what kind of religion we're talking about, can be far more interesting than simply separation. From a metaphysical perspective, the scientific world is conceptually permeated by, grounded in and dependent on a deeper reality, which could be viewed from a religious perspective; or, from the relational perspective of e.g. Martin Buber, the doing of science has the potential to be a recreation of the I-Thou meeting in a certain aspect of daily life. But Gould's approach is of course at least pragmatically helpful in setting boundaries.
In a sense, scientific research is one particular way of talking to reality. We "ask" an experiment, and reality "answers" data (and, importantly, it answers independent observers the same way). Simple perception is an example of a non-scientific kind of communication: empirical reality talks to us via our perceptual systems. Philosophical reflection lets us probe the logical relations and possibilities of reality, using intellectual tools to build on existing scientific knowledge. Religions, of course, accept a special kind of communication: revelation. If non-empirical reality exists, it by definition has to talk to us via a route "around" science. As argued above, the existence and success of science don't imply that such communication cannot exist. It only means we have a difficult, or at least a different, job: we don't have objective demonstrability to help us evaluate revelations in a scientific sense. So how do we avoid fallacies and charlatans when leaving the boundaries of science? Well, scientific research isn't the only rational human activity or intellectual context, as mathematics, philosophy (e.g., philosophy of science) and hopefully normal daily life show. Reason has been applied by the religious to find ways to evaluate and interpret what might be some form of revelation. For instance, the 10th century Jewish philosopher Saadia Gaon - who of course knew nothing of evolution or the age of the Earth and indeed accepted that creation was an event only a few thousand years past, but nevertheless rejected a literal reading of the creation stories - formulated seven criteria for evaluating claims, and stated these must also be applied to Scripture. "So, then, if we seek to establish the truth in the domain of knowledge obtained by logical inference, we must guard it against the above-mentioned five types of vitiating factors. We must, namely, make certain (a) that there is no other means than the theory in question of sustaining the truth of what is perceived with the senses, not (b) any other method of upholding what is intuitively apprehended by reason. Furthermore (c) it must not invalidate any other accepted fact, nor (d) must one part of it contradict another, let alone (e) that a theory be adopted that is worse than the one rejected. All the precautions are to be taken in addition to exercising, in the determination of the sense percepts and the rational concepts, such expert care as we have outlined before. Add to these the quality of perseverance until the process of reasoning has been completed, and we have a total of seven points that must be observed to make possible for us the accurate emergence of the truth. Should, therefore, someone come to us with an allegation in the realm of inferential knowledge, we would test his thesis by means of these seven criteria. If, upon being rubbed by their touchstone and weighed by their balance, it turns out to be correct as well as acceptable, we shall make use of it. Similarly also must we proceed with the subject matters of authentic tradition - I mean the books of prophecy." One might or might not agree with Saadia Gaon's specific approach or assumptions - we have the benefit of centuries of progress after all - but the point I'd like to make is this: Religious thinkers have always been aware of the difficulties of beliefs about the non-empirical world. People have attempted to construct rational models of full reality - the physical and the non-physical - in the face of significant uncertainty, but not total uncertainty. For instance, at the very least, we know that reality is such that it allows things like life, choice and religious experience to exist. So there are clues to use - which can be done more or less rationally - to build models of full reality which can be tested in their own way, against things like coherence, elegance, our own responses to the models and consistency with our - maybe subjective - experiences.
The 'religious method' underlying this process of model building is iterative, just like the scientific method is iterative. Religious beliefs influence interpretations of experience and Scripture, but also influence one's behaviour, cognition, emotion; one's point of view in the broadest sense. These effects, the experience of what it means to have faith, are interpreted as best possible within the current belief system and used to modify it. In other words, religious beliefs are modified iteratively, based on experience and evidence - so while not a scientific process, not totally dissimilar either. Beliefs from this perspective are like experimental "belief acts" or experiments, based on the current set of beliefs, to be critically evaluated and adjusted in a search for convergence. In Marrett's terms, religion has to be danced to be understood. In more traditional theological terms, arguably the central belief of Christianity is the existence of a Kingdom of God: a spiritual state of being, described extensively but metaphorically in the Gospels. The religious method can be described as the experience of, and the increasing achievement of, or the reduction in deviations from, that state. Note that this process involves nothing supernatural in a science-violating sense: the process simply uses a broader range of modalities and sources of evidence than permissible, or necessary, in science. In consequence, non-Fundamentalist religious understanding knows that it always reflects uncertainty, subjectivity and limitation, while still keeping open the possibility that an objective limit exists. Nevertheless, the claims of Fundamentalism to objectively know absolute metaphysical truth have no justification whatsoever from the point of view of this kind of religion - it's not "gateway drug" situation.
So we can have a non-Fundamentalist kind of theistic belief that's driven by subjective reasons to believe, together with objective constraining tests that the content of beliefs do not violate science or reason. There's not necessarily a slippery slope from theistic belief that interprets scientific knowledge to superstition that violates scientific knowledge. That seems to me to provide a hard division between religious styles that are and aren't science-compatible.
Defining God
The arguments and presentation of non-Fundamentalist theism so far have hopefully cleared the ground for considering theistic answers to the Common Metaphysical Question. Such answers form models of reality.
It's maybe worth briefly considering what models are; this will also be helpful in evaluating claims about what is or is not "probable" about religious faiths. Quantitative models specify a set of mathematical relationships with a finite number of parameters, while reality is considered to have infinite parameters, or at least far more than any useful model. The numerical values of such models are mapped to reality: the model might describe the distance between astronomical objects, or the speed with which something falls, and so on. Every such model is an approximation that "fits the data", or more generally "explains the evidence". Qualitative models are a little harder to define: other relationships, especially causal ones, than mathematical ones are involved, and no numerical values are directly produced. Such models might involve, for instance, expectations in social settings: you expect someone to respond to something you say in a certain way; you might relate that response to an empathic sequence of cognitive, emotional and motivational steps. If the response you get is unexpected, you'd change some aspects of the model - maybe the person has a different motivation after all - until the responses become predictable. Metaphysical models might be compared based on logical and conceptual relationships, or more subjectively on satisfaction and elegance, producing ranked world views. Religious models might produce subjective experience and subjectively evaluated states as predictions, together with metaphysical aspects. Engaging in religious modelling would be the "danced out" religion of Marett: one evaluates the dance. But the characteristic of fitting the evidence remains in all cases; the nature of the evidence just changes.
So: models always exist relative to a background of uncertainty and to other models. It isn't sufficient to think just in terms of true/false propositions that you can or can't prove. The nature of models is: you gain elegance and usefulness, at the cost of having to accept a more nuanced kind of evaluation. So with that in mind, let's go back to the specific case of religious models.
If a model is to contain God, we have to define what we mean by the term "God". But what kind of definition is sufficient, and even possible? Compare a primitive model of disease, in which the existence of viruses and bacteria are yet unknown, but certain effects of those unknown causes can already be taken advantage of. "Disease" is then defined abstractly as "that which makes us sick and spreads via close contact or bodily fluids." Or a driver could model the mechanisms of his or her car as "whatever makes it work so that it goes faster when I press the accelerator," and the essential component of the mode would be to recognize when things stop working and the car should be taken to a garage. These are "such that" or "that which" definitions, which I call abstract or implicit definitions. You have something observed, and you define something as that which caused it; or that which is such that the experience was what it was. Once you have that implicit target, you can try to learn more about it, but even knowing nothing about what the cause is doesn't prevent you from inferring it exists from what it does. Questions tend to become "what is it?", rather than "does it exist?"
An example of an implicit definition of a theistic God is:
    that on which the existence of objective, empirical reality ultimately depends, such that it is the reason for our universe being physically lawful, mathematically describable, having such organizational properties that life arises, and containing the phenomenon of consciousness; and such that it transcends the empirical universe; that is, such that it is expressed by, but not identifiable with, the essence of Nature;
    that which is felt (perhaps indirectly) as a loving Presence during subjective religious experiences; such that it explains the personal transformations and subjective states associated with certain religious beliefs or experiences.
"God exists" means that these indirect definitions refer to the same thing, which we label "God".
Note the two sides to this definition of God: on the one hand, an objective Ultimate Principle, Source, Ground of Being, etc, underlying lawfulness and consciousness; and on the other, the subjective, personal side that makes faith in such a God meaningful. The components of the implicit definition pose interesting questions separately, but parsimony comes into play in their combination. For instance, subjective religious experiences involve individuals feeling what they perceive as a divine, transcendent Presence or encounter of some kind: but what is it that is felt? Is there something more than random firings of temporal lobe neurons? Obviously such neurons must fire, since our brains work that way, but is that narrow explanation the most useful, most expressive model?
The essence of the theistic position, it seems to me, is that the best, most elegant model of reality as we experience it is that the cause of the empirical universe allowing religious experiences is also what those experiences are ultimately of; that the fact that the experiences result via empirical neurocognitive relationships with a certain kind of changing behaviour fits with how the Presence or encounter of religious experiences is experienced; and that the transformation itself is a way in which the cause continues to affect empirical reality that pushes it towards what was experienced. That is, the argument is that there is a parsimonious model to consider, in which all the components converge onto one thing. The experience that believers assign to God - the experience described in terms of pure love and beauty, ultimate meaning, and so on - could be argued to be just the way you'd expect us to respond to the theistic (e.g., Spinozan) God, analogously to recognizing the beauty of a mathematical proof or feeling awe at a scientific view of the universe.
(It may be worth noting here that one argument against the potential rationality of religious faith is that a religious person is atheist in respect to "all other gods" except the one he or she happens to believe in. But at least some different beliefs could be reasonably seen more like different specific models of God than as believing in different gods. In line with this, there are commonalities in people's understanding of God and their response to God over the world and over religions. For instance, the dissolution of ego is hardly very different from dying to the flesh, and we constantly see the idea of becoming one or harmonized in some way with whatever-we-call-that-ineffable-transcendent-Presence.)
If we define and model a (form of a) theistic God in this way, does that address some of the problems arising from characteristics that are typically assigned to God? For instance, one claim is that "God" is too complex an answer to the universe. However, this fails to acknowledge that theism can incorporate the general fact that complexity can arise from simplicity E.g., in the well-known Game of Life simulation, complex patterns and behavior arise from very simple rules. J. D. Barrow points out how the complex universe can be explained by simple rules: "We see now how it is possible for a Universe that displays unending complexity and exquisite structure to be governed by a few simple laws - perhaps just one law - that are symmetrical and intelligible..." The complexity argument is only valid for an anthropomorphic "magical engineer / sky wizard" kind of God, i.e., a straw man when considering the ideas presented above. Throughout the Judeo-Christian tradition, God has always been considered as something more than and radically different from physical creatures like us. The idea of a theistic Creator is quite close to a supremely necessary and elegant law, or something beyond even the concepts of laws - whatever underlies such laws themselves. We would always only experience such a God via some medium, which of course is the role of Christ and the Spirit in Christian theology. Note that we can experience beauty and awe in e.g. the context of mathematics and cosmology, which do not contain emotions like awe themselves; so even if God is non-anthropomorphic and above emotions Himself, the human response to God could consistently and meaningfully involve similar experiences and emotional translations. We just need to remember that we're unavoidably experiencing God from a human perspective, and not the "pure" God (which is, notably, fully in line with traditional sensibilities). Another argument is that of infinite backwards causality: what good is a Creator as an explanation, since then we have to explain the Creator? The counterargument here is two-fold. First, the theistic model gets its parsimony from being a common explanation to multiple objective and subjective "data points"; it doesn't claim to explain the universe in a mechanistic sense at all, which is the job of science. Second, to end an infinite regression, we need to break out of the causality of the empirical universe: we need any First Cause to be transcendent in some way, to no longer be something within rules of the physical universe that we want to explain. That is, we already knew we need something that doesn't need a cause in the way observable physical phenomena do. Since a transcendent God fulfils that requirement, the First Cause problem supports rather than contradicts a theistic model, although not necessarily uniquely.
The problem of evil
Any version of the idea of a loving God with the power to create the universe seems to contradict the suffering we can observe in the world. Why would a powerful, loving God allow suffering? My main argument that this is not, in fact, a good argument for atheism is that it's quite conceivable that suffering is a necessary evil for us to exist in a recognizable form. If suffering were not allowed in our universe, our universe would not be our universe and so, effectively, it and we would not exist - we'd be destroyed to save us from ourselves. Our existence as life forms is fundamentally bound together with the same features of reality that imply the existence of suffering: The complexity, lawfulness, consistence, and chaos that lead to evolution, life and sentience also lead to disease, decay and conflict. So there's a Gestalt switch one could undergo that would re-evaluate the tolerance of suffering as an act of mercy, not sadism. This, surprisingly, does not seem to be a well-known response to the problem of evil, yet it can be found reasonably directly (given that it's a parable) in the Gospels, in Matthew 13: 24-30: The Wheat and Tares: "Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
One response to the problem of evil that I do think fails is the "free will defense", at least in its simplest form: If God would prevent us from doing evil, it would interfere with His plan for us to be free beings. But, very obviously, not all suffering stems from the exertion of human will and the whole idea of free will as something outside natural causality is flawed from a basic modern understanding of human behavior and decision making (which I'd argue should be explicitly or implicitly based on the ideas in Wiener's Cybernetics). There is no conflict between human goal-directed behaviour - i.e., choice - and deterministic processes. Control systems exist by virtue of causal processes! It doesn't take away their emergent property of control, or ability to work towards an equilibrium, or endogenously motivated behaviour, or, in other words, voluntary choice or "free will"; and that doesn't take away the determinism of the component processes. To coin a phrase: this is the Free Will-versus-causality fallacy: there is no "versus". Free Will is built by causality. But in a modified form, the argument becomes a special case of the general "necessary evil" argument - without causality and a complex but consistent, predictable universe, we indeed also wouldn't have free will, but it would just be one of many things we wouldn't have.
Multiversal mercy is an idea closely linked to, but expanding upon, the "necessary evil" solution to the problem of evil. Imagine, slightly anthropomorphically, a God who would not tolerate suffering, hovering above a multiverse. That God would instantly delete, or prune away, every universe with suffering: we wouldn't even have had the chance to suffer. The cost is that we wouldn't exist at all. The multiversal mercy answer to the problem of suffering is that God allows possibly many suffering universes to exist because in the end, from the infinite perspective, their existence will be worth it. It's an act of mercy we aren't snuffed out to remove the evil and suffering in which we're bound up, as in the Parable of the Wheat and Tares. The theistic answer to the problem of evil is that whether our very existence is justified will be determined by where it eventually ends, as a stable state, not the route via which it gets there.
This leads to the ancient question about the relationship between "God" and "goodness". Our intuitive as well as scientific understanding of goodness leads us to a kind of social symmetry, or a game theoretical kernel: if we treat each other as equals, we should be able to find a set of behavioral rules that lead to a fair balance. And because the balance is fair, it will tend to be stable: if one player acts unfairly, the other players will acquire a motivation to collaborate against him. If, as above, we consider where creation is headed, it will have to be towards such a stable state: unstable states will eventually fall and be replaced, until a supremely stable social state is achieved. This must be balanced, must involve mutual respect: players will "love their neighbor as themselves". If we judge the Creator by the end-point of His creation, this end-state is what matters: and it's what we'd already intuitively call "good". Therefore, "God is good" is a meaningful and possibly true proposition, given the existence of a God expressed by Nature's endpoint.
Eternal life
I'd like to speculate very briefly on consciousness and the idea of eternal life, with a simple thought experiment. Imagine looking out of a window at a mountain. Now imagine someone else, many years later, looking out of the same window at the same mountain. Under reasonably mild assumptions, there would be very strong similarities between the conscious experience of you and that other person - spanning time, perhaps beyond your own lifetime. In a sense, your states of consciousness at those moments, in that respect, are the same thing. So after your death, this moment of your consciousness is copied, re-incarnated if you will, in this other person. What, then, about more complex or more personal states? The second person could have a more or less similar emotional response to the view; could be looking out of the window for more or less similar reasons; could have more or less similar memory structures related to the experience. So there's a scale of similarity of consciousness that could be achieved.
My impression is that the traditional religious concept of "life everlasting" is far less like "angels on clouds" than something like a state of consciousness that would exist in a converged state of the universe, as mentioned above in the problem-of-evil response. For the state to converge, it must be stable, and if it's to contain conscious life, it must be amenable to life's stable existence. Hence, there wouldn't be things in that state that would lead to self-annihilating wars, for instance. What kind of personalities would need to populate that living-yet-stable universe for that to be the case? What kind of conscious experiences would they have? Christianity would suggest that we'd need Christ-like personalities: extreme, individually irrational altruism. So to the extent that individuals can achieve that personality, that state of experiencing, now, their experiences will be the same as those of their future brothers-and-sisters-in-mind. We could say that we've found a way for our consciousness to have, to partake in, that life everlasting, without having to make claims about stereotypical and problematic life-after-death scenarios.
The other side of life everlasting is hell. The stereotypical belief is that Christianity asserts something like this: God judges people on whether they believe some set of theological statements, and tortures those who don't believe in those statements for eternity after they die. But this strange view contradicts traditional religious sources. The Bible, in the first place, talks about the afterlife in metaphors that contradict each other as soon as taken literally; it often talks about destruction rather than torture; and it reserves whatever these metaphors refer to for the uncharitable; the unloving; the hypocrites. The parable of the sheep and the goats isn't unknown, but its point seems to be frequently ignored. Matthew 25:31-46. The Sheep and the Goats: "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life." It's conspicuous that what the "goats" did wrong, according to just about the most authoritative source in Christianity, was failing to care for their neighbor in real-life, practical ways - not failing to submit to some religious authority or to affirm some dogma.
Conclusion
So, if we take all the anti-scientific stuff out of religion, what's left of it? I hope that this text has shown at least a possibility that what we're left with isn't necessarily no-religion, but maybe better religion. That kind of religion could be expressed by the final quote of this text, from John's first letter, 1 John 4: 7 - 8: "Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." We're so familiar with this idea it's maybe lost how, at the very least, fascinatingly bizarre it is! This presents a vision of an active, lived-out form of faith that connects ontology with a certain kind of extreme altruism, for which it seems trivially obvious that it's about something different from, and potentially complementary to, the kind of value offered by science.

Academic education largely concerns knowledge and skills. Where there is attention to ethics, this tends to focus on study-related misconduct such as plagiarising assignments and, more recently, methodological misconduct. 
The current paper argues that it is also essential to teach students about social misconduct in science, with a focus on questionable collaboration practices. 
First, this would increase future early career researchers’ ability to succeed and avoid academic snares. 
Enhancing this ability would appear to be an ethical responsibility going hand-in-hand with our attempts at endowing students with skills that we know could be exploited. 
Second, such teaching would establish authoritative norms about collaborative practices that are and are not acceptable. This would help to adjust scientific attitudes in next generations of graduates, to the benefit of both themselves and science.
Teaching on science-specific social misconduct would also naturally tie in with addressing general forms of antisocial conduct which also occur in academia, such as bullying or sexual harassment. 
The paper provides a framework for defining and recognizing questionable collaboration practices, and for how to provide students with the attitudes, concepts and skills necessary to protect themselves as they enter the reality of the academic arena.

The impact of research misconduct on students
Attention is commonly given to academic misconduct in the context of students’ studies, as commonly reflected in “misconduct” sections of typical universities’ handbooks. This kind of misconduct has received recent research attention. For instance, students may have others do their work for them and commit plagiarism, or otherwise attempt to acquire undeserved credit. When paid for, this is termed “contract cheating” (Clarke & Lancaster, 2013) and has been reported to be increasing, with up to around 15% of students likely to have used this method (Newton, 2018). Such directly study-related misconduct is clearly an important issue. However, misconduct and questionable practices in academic research, rather than in the student experience directly, can also negatively affect students, in three broad ways. First, unethical research negatively affects scientific culture (Engel, 2015) and ultimately weakens the quality of the scientific literature, with authors suggesting unjustified levels of evidence for claims, sometimes termed “hyping” (Martin, 2016). This inherently weakens the value of students’ education as they will likely be learning material that is at least partly incorrect. Further, the reputation of the students’ field will be negatively affected, as in the replication crisis in psychology (Ioannidis, 2005; Murayama et al., 2013; Wagenmakers et al., 2012), and unreliable knowledge will also potentially affect those students’ future ability to perform to a high or even safe standard. Second, many students will observe unethical research-related behaviour in some way. For example, researchers known to have bad reputations may be seen to be highly successful at acquiring funding; professors may joke about torturing data until it confesses (Simmons et al., 2011); there may be examples of bullying, e.g., by PIs or professors, being accepted for extended periods of time (Cassell, 2011; McKay et al., 2008); researchers could express or demonstrate plagiarism in its myriad forms beyond just word-for-word copying (Martin, 1994, 2016), including by claiming too much credit for students’ work (Martin, 2013); and so on. Students exposed to such experiences are learning that such behaviour is, at least, not inimical to success in academia, and perhaps it even appears to be necessary. This is teaching the ethical opposite of what an academic education should aim to provide – honestly, transparency, collegiality, the willingness to actually do the hard work of science, and so forth. Finally, some students are future junior researchers, especially PhD students. They could therefore be negatively affected by academic misconduct directly. Are they being adequately prepared for this encounter?
The aim of the current paper is to argue that academic education needs to provide students with explicit, authoritative, and unambiguous information and training on “social” as well as study-related and methodological academic misconduct.
Research-related academic misconduct and collaboration
In recent years, concern for questionable research practices (John et al., 2012) has risen, hand in hand with the so-called replication crisis in psychology (Murayama et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2011). This has focused on statistical issues. Take, for instance, p-hacking, the practice of varying methodological choices and picking the one that gives the best outcome, generally being the lowest p-value (although the exact same problem would occur for any alternative statistical outcome, e.g., the Bayes factor, that can be manipulated). This has been successfully widely branded as misconduct, and disapproval of p-hacking has become a norm that can be communicated to students as part of their methodology and statistics classes. There are also non-statistical forms of misconduct, on which some light is already being shined, related to general social interactions. Bullying, for instance, was long tolerated – the “star” researcher, the “top talent”, sometimes being given leeway in their mistreatment of students or post-docs (Cassell, 2011; Chu, 2018; McKay et al., 2008). The bullying problem has reached mainstream media, in articles such as “We need a bigger conversation about bullying in academia” (Anonymous, 2018b). Sexual harassment in academia has also long been recognized (Fitzgerald et al., 1988; van Roosmalen and McDaniel, 1999) and remains an issue, also being brought to light in publications outside academia such as the article “As a young academic, I was repeatedly sexually harassed at conferences” (Anonymous, 2018a).
There is however a further, subtler but nevertheless harmful, form of academic social misconduct, here termed questionable collaboration practices (QCP). The term QCP is intended to cover a broad range of related forms of intellectual exploitation and plagiarism. Rather than involving statistical misconduct or general antisocial behaviour, QCP is misconduct specifically related to the social aspect of doing scientific research, for which the overall term “collaboration” is used here. Formulations of general ethics concerning collaboration have been articulated in, e.g., the Montreal Statement on Research Integrity in Cross-Boundary Research Collaborations (developed as part of the 3rd World Conference on Research Integrity, 2013) and the Singapore Statement on Research Integrity (Resnik & Shamoo, 2011), but issues surrounding intellectual exploitation do not appear to be widely recognized as requiring specific attention and labelling (Martin, 2013, 2016).
Science at every level involves collaboration: all researchers build on others’ work and require the often somewhat selfless contribution of peers – from laboratory know-how passed on via experienced technicians or researchers to voluntary peer-review and editing to multi-centre, years-long research projects. This cooperative, trust-based fabric stands in sharp contrast to competitive, winner-take-all academic systems (Van den Berghe, 1970; Woolston, 2014; Xie, 2014). An individual playing the academic game is incentivized to improve their chances to survive and win in terms of their career, via whichever metrics the score is kept; and this is inherently to the detriment of the chances of others. That some academics in some sense cheat at the game has been described as a commonplace observation: “The point that merit sometimes takes a backseat to more unpalatable considerations in advancing academic careers is hardly an original observation. Indeed, made merely as an offhand remark, it would seem little more than a commonplace. It is implied when someone is referred to as a sycophant, intriguer, or poseur” (Lewis, 1975). One way to win the game via cheating is to exploit others, i.e., QCP. The idea of the wily hustler, manipulative organizer, or dominant group leader exploiting talented but vulnerable students or researchers is likely not unfamiliar to the reader. While anecdotal evidence of such interactions abounds, hard data seem more difficult to come by. This could be related to lack of recognition or labelling of the behaviour as undesirable – once the problem is acknowledged, research efforts could be devoted to its prevalence and consequences. Clearly, even if exploitative strategies are common and effective, they should be normatively undesirable, being for one thing a form of plagiarism – one person is aiming to unfairly profit from, and ultimately get credit for, the work or abilities of another. The ability of the current academic system to protect itself and students from misconduct will realistically always be limited. Educators need to respond adequately to this reality. To do so, students need to be taught strong norms concerning the concept of QCP and exploitation, presented as a matter of course during their studies in the same way that they are, for instance, made aware of p-hacking being unacceptable. Such norms obviously may not fit all academics’ agenda. As will be clear, there is an uncomfortable friction between anti-exploitation norms and the winner-take-all system and the associated widespread use of (PhD) students and post-docs in a hierarchical lab structure. Nevertheless, it appears difficult to deny that at the least, students need guidance on what is and isn’t appropriate in terms of working with or for other people. This is a special responsibility for educators who could be, as it were, cursing students with competence, that is: We want to make students good researchers with strong skills – but that makes them targets for exploitation as well. Teaching research skills must therefore go hand in hand with teaching the ethics of collaboration and social self-defense skills.
Defining and recognizing questionable collaboration practices
QCP can be defined in contrast to three positive principles of an ideal academic collaboration: consent, contribution, and credit. Together these principles represent what could be termed ownership of personal scientific competence: first, that individuals have the right to spend their time working towards their own scientific goals; second, that they may select only collaborators they believe will make a significant additional contribution to their aims; and third, that they have the right for all contributions to be accurately credited. Note that consent can, of course, be given altruistically and freely – to support a collaborative project or peers can be a scientific goal. The principle only claims that this should be voluntary. This is necessary to avoid a tyranny of the incompetent in which, rather than the norm being to personally develop the scientific competence one requires, scientific support can be demanded at the cost of others to fulfil one’s own personal ambitions. Given these principles, it is unethical to be pressured or induced to work to the personal advantage of other researchers, to disproportionally profit from others, or to misrepresent the distribution of real contributions. QCP entails any form of this kind of theft of competence. It is not only unfair to the student or researcher as an individual but also harms the academic system by forcing positive, trust-based attitudes to become more defensive and incorrectly assigning credit and therefore benefits and, ultimately, power.
On the other hand, of course, collaboration is often necessary and positive. In the ideal collaboration, each person makes a real contribution that is both necessary and reflected in the eventual distribution of credit; this could involve either sharing work or contributing to different parts of a study. Awareness of QCP will hopefully help students and researchers identify and focus on collaborations that are in fact mutually beneficial and fair. Evaluating contributions will always be a matter of judgment, but as a prerequisite to that the issues of QCP and real contributions must be recognized as important and, in particular, ethically appropriate to critically consider. Thus, an important element of training students to navigate QCP should involve thinking critically about what “real” contributions entail. This could build on good authorship practices (Baskin & Gross, 2011; Bavdekar, 2012; van Loon, 1997), but the first aim should simply be to start an explicit discussion that lets students reflect on typical cases. For instance, an idea or research question could be considered a real contribution only if it is an individual intellectual step beyond what can be simply taken from the existing literature with minimal effort. Taking an organizing role is of questionable value if other participants could in fact have organized themselves perfectly well. There are middle-man contributions that arguably should not be considered worthy of scientific credit – it can be questioned whether or not bringing relevant people into contact with each other involves collegiality rather than collaboration. Providing access to resource is a difficult case – it may be worth it to a requesting researcher to buy such access with a collaboration and ultimate co-authorship, but is it ethical? Finally, it should always be very critically considered what real contribution individuals make to studies of which the research question is closely linked to specialist techniques, who themselves lack the real-life knowledge and ability to perform that kind of research.
QCP applies to student research projects and research jobs as well as peer-to-peer collaborations not directly linked to study or employment. Although the freedom to decline research is of course lost to some extent within employment or apprenticeship-type roles, it seems that this should not affect the ethical duty to, to the greatest extent possible, allow the choice to select such a role to be based on informed consent and to avoid all forms of plagiarism and competence theft. Supervisor exploitation has been previously noted as a form of QCP, and typical tactics, such as devaluation of the student’s contribution, have been helpfully identified and could be taught to students and staff (Martin, 2013). Once ethical norms are established the relevant ethics of employers, labs and departments can also more easily become part of formal and informal discussions that can help steer individuals towards beneficial experiences. In the context of university students, this may enhance student experience and the probability of good longer-term education outcomes. While the focus of the current paper is on students, it should be noted that other individuals may well be vulnerable to QCP, including but not limited to junior staff.
Teaching and changing attitudes on QCP
Currently, teaching students about QCP and how to defend themselves from it appears to occur in an ad-hoc fashion at best. This section uses the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1988; Orbeil et al., 1997) as a framework to provide some basic principles for conveying ethical and critical attitudes concerning QCP and exploitative practices. In the theory, intentions to behave a certain way are determined by (1) social norms, (2) perceived behavioural control, and (3) personal attitudes. These aspects tie directly in to education. First, concerning social norms, simply presenting ethical rules and guidelines as part of the curriculum establishes that they have the approval of the university, providing normative authority. A secondary consequence of such teaching is that once QCP issues are officially taught to students, it would be highly and conspicuously hypocritical for department members to commit misconduct. This teaching could thus conceivably benefit the academic environment. One concrete possibility would be to develop codes of conduct reflecting ethical norms on exploitation, to be signed by supervisors and students. Second, perceived behavioural control in navigating pressures involving QCP is supported by the social norms. Students need to be confident they have the right to decline anything they perceive as exploitative or simply insufficiently equitable in terms of contribution. Perceived control could also be enhanced via teaching methods such as role-playing (Karatay & Gürarslan Baş, 2017). Perceived and actual control would also be increased simply by learning about common forms of misconduct and becoming a critical evaluator of suggested contributions or “tokens” of expertise. For instance, students who have learned about the issue of ghost authorship (Baskin & Gross, 2011; Bavdekar, 2012; LaFollette, 1992; van Loon, 1997) may be more likely to look beyond superficial credentials. Some strategies that could help students increase their control have been provided in previous work, such as careful note-keeping and minuting of meetings (Martin, 2013). Agreements should be made early and in writing, shared for confirmation over email. Learning about QCP could help students think more critically about which projects they accept and which future jobs they take. For instance, potential PhD students need to learn to critically evaluate potential supervisors by making sure they talk to multiple possible supervisors as well as current and previous students, if possible, and check the publication records of previous students. This is of course a difficult task, but at least some awareness and a critical attitude will serve students well, and hopefully they will have disinterested lecturers they can approach for mentorship and tips. Finally, the individual’s attitudes and values will play a role. Does the individual care about the corrosive impact that QCP have on science? This can only be taught to a certain extent. However, simple self-interest is sufficient to motivate an avoidance of exploitation, which subsequently benefits both the individual and the academic system.
Conclusion
Academia is a complex system, involving many incentives that can lead to undesirable conduct. Part of the responsibility of educators is to teach students to navigate that system. In particular if we give students exploitable skills, we can foresee that some of them will indeed be exploited. Given the winner-take-all mechanisms common in science, such individuals may not recover from this, and it seems at least possible that unfair practices may even be unhealthy, contributing to the high incidence of serious mental health problems in academia, with particularly concerning rates in PhD students (Evans et al., 2018; Levecque et al., 2017). Therefore, educators need to train students to recognize QCP and be able to conceptualize and verbalize any concerns appropriately, if only to themselves. Students need to be very comfortable with critically considering whether a collaboration is or is not OK. Further, teachers in the role of representatives of their university and to an extent the scientific world need to clearly identify and acknowledge QCP as a form of misconduct just as unacceptable as plagiarism in writing, bullying, sexual harassment or p-hacking. This is not to suggest that education alone will be able to solve the issues of QCP, general social misconduct and cheating in academia. Such problems are persistent and arguably even incentivized by some aspects of academic systems of funding, employment and career progression. Even well-intended metrics will only imperfectly reward good science rather than unethical strategies such as hyping, exploitation or plagiarism, thereby running the risk not only of victimization of individuals but also the spread of attitudes and strategies damaging to institutes and scientific fields (Engel, 2015). It is therefore an important responsibility of academic leadership and policy makers to identify and censure, rather than reward, questionable practices. Education may, however, be an essential factor in changing the prevalence of attitudes and behaviours in future generations of scientists, and thereby at least in some cases change the expected payoff of academic corruption.

- Predictive Visual Probe Task (cVPT): Uses predictive cues to indicate where emotionally salient (but task-irrelevant) stimuli may appear; probe-only trials yield an anticipatory attentional bias indexed by RTs to predicted locations. This design reduces exemplar-driven noise and can produce reliable bias scores (typically ~.7–.8; up to .89 with blockwise probe-location probabilities). Biases relate to risky drinking and anxiety, and reliability collapses when cues are nonpredictive, supporting a genuinely anticipatory component. Independent replications report good reliability and anxiety links.
- Trial-to-trial carryover: Attentional bias on trial N depends on the previous probe’s location (N−1), including asymmetric effects for threat. Robust in a “diagonalized” VPT with direct location–response mapping; largely absent in standard dot-probe tasks.
- Threat anticipation and freezing: Freezing (reduced sway/bradycardia) reflects action preparation: being armed increases freezing; threat slows responses on unrelated tasks starting ~600 ms post-cue and diminishing by ~1200 ms. Threat can also lower thresholds for threat-relevant actions (apparent impulsivity). Sleep deprivation mainly reduces accuracy.
- R3 “Reflective Cycle” model: Recasts impulsive–reflective differences as a continuous response-selection delay parameter shaped by learning; simulations illustrate threshold dynamics. Large language models can serve as proxies for “automatic associations” (semantic similarity predicts IAT effects) and may aid stimulus selection.
- ABM control issue: The common “random” control likely trains irrelevance (an active intervention), while active ABM can inadvertently increase salience (“salience side-effect”). Predictive-cue ABM may avoid this by training toward/away from predicted categories rather than presented exemplars; initial evidence supports feasibility.
Overall: With predictive cues and optimized designs, behavioral measures of attentional bias can be reliable and informative.

Anticipatory automaticity and the predictive Visual Probe Task (cVPT)
The predictive cue-based Visual Probe Task, cVPT or predVPT for short (Gladwin, 2017, but first refined to its current form with separate training phases in Gladwin & Vink, 2018), is a possibly useful variant of the dot-probe task based on predictive cues that provide information about where emotionally salient but task-irrelevant stimuli may appear. Trials on which emotionally salient stimuli (but not probe stimuli) occur are intermixed with trials on which probe stimuli (but not the emotionally salient stimuli) occur. This provides a bias score derived from performance on probe trials that is based on predicted stimulus categories rather than actually-presented exemplars. The bias was termed the anticipatory attentional bias or, more theoretically neutrally, predictive cue-based attentional bias.
The two trial types of the task are illustrated below: Picture trials establish (over an explicit training phase, in the current version of the task) the expectation, i.e., of where stimuli from each category may appear; here, blue Os would predict alcohol stimuli, and yellow bars would predict non-alcohol stimuli. Probe trials require a response and provide the behavioural measure of whether attention has been affected by the predictive cues: In the illustration, the probe stimulus appeared at the predicted alcohol location, and would be expected to be relatively fast for riskier drinkers. Note that a non-probe stimulus is presented as well (the VV), since otherwise it seems likely that the basic exogenous attentional process of detecting the appearance of a probe by itself could remove any measurable behavioural effects of salience-driven anticipatory attention.
The use of predictive cues, together with other task features, was expected to reduce undesirable trial-to-trial variation, in particular that caused by which exemplars of stimulus categories happen to have been presented on a particular trial. The cVPT was therefore used to study Attentional Bias Variability (Gladwin & Vink, 2018) involving alcohol stimuli, which was predicted and confirmed to be associated with conflicting automatic associations, measured using dual Single-Target Implicit Association Tests. Further, the anticipatory bias was correlated with risky drinking. The reduction of exemplar-related variation was also thought to potentially improve the reliability of bias scores. Good reliability (around .7 to .8) of the anticipatory bias was indeed found for alcohol (Gladwin, 2019), and individual differences in bias were again associated with risky drinking. A series of follow-up studies (Gladwin, Banic, Figner & Vink, 2020) further explored the nature of the bias and individual differences. One important finding of these studies was the validation of the previously found reliability in terms of predicted stimulus categories rather than cue features, as reliability was very low when the cues were made non-predictive.
Anticipatory spatial attentional bias to threat (Gladwin, Möbius, McLoughlin & Tyndall, 2019) was also found to exist, and this was replicated using an improved procedure (Gladwin, Figner & Vink, 2019) for assessing the reliability of the anticipatory component of the bias that involved reversing the predictive values of the cues. For both studies, this reliability was high when considered in the context of reports of near-zero reliability for traditional tasks and the relatively complex task designs, but nevertheless only modest in psychometric terms; and it was lower, around .4 to .5, than the reliability found for the alcohol-related bias. However, a further study (Gladwin & Vink, 2020) confirmed that when the task and procedure were optimized for reliability, a similar split-half reliability as for the alcohol bias, around .7, could be achieved. Reliability increased to .89 when probe location probability was manipulated to alternate between blocks with a task-induced bias towards versus away from threat (Gladwin, Halls & Vink, 2021). This study also showed that anxiety was associated with stronger avoidance of threat in blocks in which there was a congruent task-induced bias away from threat; that is, it seems that in blocks where there was a task-induced bias towards threat, the influence of individual differences in automatic, emotional avoidance was suppressed. Good reliability of this kind of predictive cues has also been replicated independently, in a three-experiment study that also found associations with anxiety (Basanovic, 2024).
The interpretation of the bias as anticipatory was based on the predicted outcome-based cognitive response selection model (defining "R3-reflectivity", see below) that originally motivated the anticipatory attentional bias work. This was supported in a predictive ABM training study (Gladwin, Möbius & Becker, 2019), in which training towards or away from predicted threat generalized to post-training stimulus-evoked bias; i.e., it's not just about the visual features of the cues becoming salient themselves via conditioning. This approach may also address a potential issue with usual Attention Bias Modification paradigms, namely that even when training attention away from certain stimulus categories, those categories are still task-relevant and therefore being made or kept salient, termed the salience side-effect (Gladwin, 2017).
There are lots of interesting open questions. For instance, the interpretation of effects so far has been relatively equivocal on specific underlying processes, taking an overall "attention as selection for action" perspective. That is: for an effect to be "attentional", it only needs to be caused by the (predicted) spatial positions of salient visual stimuli. For example, it may be that response priming occurs in response to the location of predicted emotional stimuli in a detection task, which could be seen as a problem for interpretation - but such response priming would be caused by biasing action towards certain stimuli and their spatial location, which is subsequently translated into the associated spatial movement; behavioural effects would therefore still be a reflection of attentional bias towards certain stimulus categories as desired. What is indeed unknown is what specific cognitive process most proximally causes reaction time effects, but this is a different, more granular question than whether an attentional bias exists and can be evidenced using a given task design. It may well be that next steps should use psychophysiological measures, like the LRP or lateralized occipital or parietal alpha amplitude, rather than trying to probe component processes via performance and complex task conditions. It might be found that that there's a trade-off between a task with good psychometric properties and a task that attempts to break apart naturally coordinated processes. In other words: Perhaps the starting point for trying to measure attentional bias behaviourally should be a unified "look and move" concept, rather then trying to separate "look" from "move" too soon. (See also below, where using a detection task seems to unveil a very clear trial-to-trial effect.)
The results so far add to the evidence that the well-known psychometric problems with measuring attentional bias using traditional task variants should not lead to premature dismissal of such behavioural measures in general: reliability of the bias can be sufficiently high in principle. There are new tasks out there with various different features (predictive cues being just one example) that promise stronger empirical foundations (Sharpe, Halls & Gladwin, 2022).

Attentional carryover: Effects of trial-to-trial history on attentional bias variability
One potential cause of within-subject Attentional Bias Variability - whether this is considered noise or an informative measure in itself - concerns trial-to-trial carryover effects (Gladwin & Figner, 2019). Carryover refers to the dependence of the attentional bias on trial N on the probe location on trial N - 1. This was found to be the case using a so-termed "diagonalised" Visual Probe Task, which was specifically optimized for studying trial-to-trial fluctuations. Effects were found for different colours and for threat-versus-neutral stimuli. Responding to a probe stimulus at the location of a given colour induced an attentional bias towards that colour on the next trial. Carryover for threat versus neutral stimuli was asymmetrical: a bias towards threat versus neutral cue was only found following trials on which the participant responded to a probe at the location of the threat versus neutral cue. This pattern of previous-probe-dependence of the threat-related bias was also found for the anticipatory attentional bias (Gladwin, Figner & Vink, 2019). The effect was subsequently replicated with different facial stimuli and task variants (Gladwin, Jewiss & Vink, 2020). In this study it was also tested whether considering the previous trial's target location could result in more reliable scores even with exemplar-based (rather than predictive cue-based) biases and replicable relationships with various mental health measures, but this was not the case.
Some forms of carryover effects may be related to trauma symptoms (Gladwin, 2017), although this study used a traditional dot-probe task that did not show a dependence of the bias on the previous probe location as found using the diagonalized VPT.
Interestingly, work by others also indicates that the standard dot-probe task doesn't capture the effect (Maxwell, Fang & Carlson, 2022). The big difference, I suspect, is that the diagonalized task has strong stimulus-response compatibility - you see the probe at a given location, you respond with a key mapped to that location. In the traditional dot-probe task, in contrast, the response is unrelated to probe location, breaking that link. However, another reason could be that the diagonalized task was designed to remove various kinds of trial-to-trial factors that could interfere with effects, by having disjoint sets of responses and stimulus locations on successive trials.

Threat anticipation and freezing
Freezing (operationalized as body sway reduction and bradycardia in a threatening context) may be a preparatory, rather than "helpless", state (Gladwin, Hashemi, van Ast & Roelofs, 2016). We used a Virtual Shooting Task to manipulate the ability to prepare defensive responses to threat by making participants either armed or unarmed. Freezing was very strongly related to being armed, and within the armed-condition additionally to the degree of threat. The scientific concept of freezing has to be separated from the idea of "being frozen in fear." The task has been used to study neural effects related to freezing and the freeze-fight transition (e.g., Hashemi et al., 2019). Interactions between threat effects and sleep deprivation were studied using a stop-signal version of the task (van Peer, Gladwin & Nieuwenhuys, 2019). This showed that threat affected impulsivity while sleep deprivation caused a general reduction of accuracy.
Freezing effects were further explored behaviourally in a subsequent study on distraction and freeze-terminating stimuli (Gladwin & Vink, 2018). We looked at the effect of only-anticipated versus actual virtual attacks as distractors in an emotional Sternberg task. While a task-irrelevant attack was impending, reaction times on the primary working memory task were slowed; but this appeared to be due to a reversible inhibited state that was released after the attack actually occurred. Note that explanations in terms of distraction would predict that the attack actually occurring should lead to more slowing of responses, opposite to the observed effect.
Threat-induced anticipatory slowing of responses on a threat-unrelated task was confirmed in a subsequent series of studies (Gladwin & Vink, 2020). In these studies visually neutral predictive cues were used as distractors, instead of the previously used face versus no-face cues. This was done to focus on improving the comparability between impending (but not actual) attack versus control (no risk of attack) trials. (Comparisons between anticipated and actual attack could better be made using the task design in the previous study.) These studies further explored temporal dynamics of the response by varying the time between the cue and the probe stimulus, showing that the slowing effect arose after around 600 ms and had decreased by 1200 ms. Note that this contrasts with the threat-induced impulsivity found in, e.g., Gladwin, Möbius & Vink (2019). This minor paradox was interpreted in terms of selective lowering of the response threshold to threat-relevant stimuli.
The figure below provides an example of the reaction time curves from the anticipatory study. Curves are plotted for the conditions Safe, Threat and Attack. The horizontal axis shows the Cue-Stimulus Interval [ms], i.e., the time between the presentation of the cue determining the threat of an attack and, for Safe and Threat trials, the appearance of the probe for the working memory task; on Attack trials, the attack stimulus occured first. The primary interest in this study was in the difference between Safe and Threat trials, when no attack occurred. The figure shows the increase in reaction times due to predicted threat arising around half a second after cue presentation. This followed an initial slowing for both Threat and Safe trials that seems likely to reflect an orienting process.

The R3 "Reflective Cycle" model and computational models of automatic associations
The R3 model is the Reprocessing/Reentrance and Reinforcement model of Reflectivity, or "Reflective Cycle" model. It's an attempt at deconstructing and redefining dual-process models: see section 5 of Gladwin, Figner, Crone & Wiers (2011) and this chapter (Gladwin & Figner, 2014) for an argument why we should talk about emergent states of impulsive versus reflective processing, defined parametrically in terms of response selection search time, rather than processes with particular features or separable systems. The model generated the anticipatory attentional bias line of research and more generally serves to justify but evolve the continued use of traditional dual-process concepts (e.g., in prospective memory; Gladwin, Jewiss, Banic & Pereira, 2020). The "R3" label was used in tribute to the well-known 3D space of real numbers, since it aims to contain theories spanned by a limited set of relevant concepts. The theoretical aim of the model is not to coin new terms or introduce "new" concepts. Rather it simply proposes a theoretical space based on existing concepts grounded in cognitive neuroscience, within which we may be able to better conceptualize what we now model as automatic versus controlled processes. The activation of neural information processing underlying behaviour and cognition is generally time-dependent, and so simply delaying the final selection of a response may change the preferred response and the available information. The principle illustrated by this model is that impulsive versus reflective behavior can be generated by a continuous underlying parameter - how much will you delay? - rather than different types of processes. However, faster processes (e.g., more strongly reinforced associations, or simpler computations) will naturally dominate response selection more after shorter than longer delays. Further, certain situations will naturally teach individuals to respond optimizing speed versus more elaboration - more "emotional" situations will thus tend to be linked to more impulsive processing. This close relationship between neurocognitive processes underlying reflectivity and learning/adaptation to the environment has been argued to play a core role in understanding how a vast array of biological and environmental factors interact to determine the development of self-regulation (Vink et al., 2020).
Some of the concepts of the model are illustrated in simulations (Gladwin & Figner, 2022, preprint). The simulations hopefully make some points of the model more concrete: (1) how merely changing a parameter that controls response selection time, in combination with temporal dynamics of response value, can lead to more reflective versus more automatic response selections, and (2) how the learning environment can set this reflectivity parameter via reinforcement, by rewarding or punishing fast responses versus taking the time to reflect. The figure below shows an example of a trial with a typical random walk of activation but a dynamic response threshold. If the decay of the threshold had been slow enough, i.e., "more reflective", the early response (represented by hitting the lower curve) would have been avoided and replaced by the response represented by the upper curve.
While the R3 model aims to help conceptualize the relationship between reflective and automatic processing, existing computational semantic models may be translatable into the "automatic" side of the equation. Neural network language models learn from actual language usage, in large text corpora, and represent meaning in a hidden layer of, e.g., 300 neurons. These representations have been shown to allow vector algebra to be applied to word meaning; in particular, the cosine distance between representations provides a geometric measure of semantic similarity. A possible way to flesh out "automatic associations" between concepts is therefore to consider a stronger association as a closer semantic similarity. Such similarities were found between the presentations of words related to nature and to mental health, in line with a broadly-defined biophilia hypothesis (Gladwin, Markwell & Panno, 2022). Further, in the context of alcohol-valence associations, semantic similarities defined at item level were found to be statistically associated with behavioural congruence effects on an Implicit Association Test (IAT) variant (Gladwin, 2022).
(To play around with this kind of associations - work in progress making things more accessible than the original scripts here.)
Theoretically, these relationships suggest that such language models, although coming from a different field, might also serve as models of cognitive associations. Methodologically, the results raise the hypothetical possibility that model-based scores could be used to select stimuli for various aims - stronger similarities for large effect sizes, but weaker ones for reliability.

The control condition issue in ABM
As also noted by others (Badura-Brack et al., 2015; Khanna et al., 2015; Tiggemann & Kemps, 2020), it seems that the typical control condition in ABM studies - where there is a randon, non-predictive relationship between cues and probes - might actually be an effective intervention (Gladwin, 2017; Gladwin, Möbius & Becker, 2019). If so, this could obviously play a part in the lack of clear effects of such interventions.
Although the traditional narrative for the control condition considers it neutral, it could be seen as a way to "train irrelevance" - the participant learns that the emotional stimuli involved in the training don't matter and can be ignored. In active conditions, the cues are informative and therefore participants learn to pay attention to the emotional stimuli involved, even if within the task there's also a shift away being trained. But perhaps the former training aspect is as, or more, important. This was termed the "salience side-effect" when it occurred in a variant of ABM involving alternating biases (Gladwin, 2017). One possible solution may be to use a task with predictive cues, as in the cued/predictive Visual Probe Task discussed above; participants would then be trained to direct attention towards versus away from the "idea" of predicted emotional categories, but are not being trained to attend to actually-presented emotional stimuli. A first experiment suggested this kind of training could work (Gladwin, Möbius & Becker, 2019) and may be worth following up further (Cahill et al., 2025).

Automatic associations involving alcohol have been proposed to play a role in drinking behavior. Such associations are often assessed using implicit measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Neural network language models provide computational measures of semantic relationships between words. These model-based measures could be related to behavioral alcohol-related associations as observed using the IAT. If so, this could provide a step toward better understanding of the nature of automatic associations and their relationship to behavior. The current study therefore aimed to test whether there is a systematic covariation over items between model-based and behavior-based associations. Analyses were performed for two single-target IATs from a previously published study. One task involved alcohol versus nonalcohol drinks and positive associates, and the other alcohol versus nonalcohol drinks and negative associates. The GenSim library and a pretrained word2vec model were used to calculate a relative computational association between specific items from the positive and negative categories, respectively, and the alcohol versus nonalcohol word sets. In both tasks, a significant covariance between items’ computational and behavioral measures of association was found over participants. The results thus add to the information on the relationship between neural network language models and psychological associations. They may provide methodological strategies for task design and data analysis. Models of semantic associations connect computational linguistics and social-cognitive psychology and may provide a theoretical link between measures of alcohol-related associations using verbal stimuli and alcohol-related cognition and behaviors.

Natural language processing involves machine learning methods that generate a representation of the meaning of words. The neural network language model (NNLM) approach to this, such as the word2vec algorithm, trains a neural network to predict the surrounding words of a given word (Mikolov, Chen, et al. Citation2013; Mikolov, Sutskever, et al. Citation2013). This produces a hidden layer of, for example, 300 nodes, the weights to which can be used as a vector that represents this kind of word meaning, and that can be used to connect vector calculus to meaning. For instance, using these vectors, ‘monarch’ plus ‘female’ minus ‘male’ does indeed produce a vector close to that for ‘queen’, while ‘monarch’ plus ‘male’ minus ‘female’ is closer to ‘king’. This approach not only provides an interesting computationally defined conceptual framework for meaning, but also a range of methods of potential interest to psychological questions, leveraging textual data with emotional or psychiatric content (Tausczik and Pennebaker Citation2010; Yin et al. Citation2019; Min et al. Citation2021). However, it remains to be determined to what extent, and in which ways, such computational models reflect actual human cognition. In particular, do they have the potential to better understand the nature of automatic associations such as those involved in dual process models of addiction (Stacy and Wiers Citation2010; McClure and Bickel Citation2014)?
For this to be the case, it is necessary to show that computational similarities between semantic vectors are related to psychological associations as measured via behavioral effects. One approach to such measurement is the Implicit Association Test, IAT (Greenwald et al. Citation1998; De Houwer et al. Citation2009a). This is a reaction time task in which participants categorize stimuli. Critically, multiple categories are assigned to the same response. For instance, the task could involve using a left-hand response button that represents the categories ‘insects’ and ‘dirty’ and a right-hand response button that represents ‘flowers’ and ‘pretty’. This mapping of categories to responses would be considered congruent, as associated categories are mapped to the same response. The incongruent mapping would have ‘insects’ and ‘pretty’ mapped to one response button, and ‘flowers’ and ‘dirty’ mapped to the other. The IAT presents blocks alternating between such congruent and incongruent mappings, and incongruent mappings result in slower reaction times and higher error rates than congruent mappings. We briefly note that although the validity of the IAT, in particular as a measure of individual differences, is debated (Blanton et al. Citation2009; De Houwer et al. Citation2009b), basic congruence effects such as those involving insects versus flowers are strong and replicable (Greenwald et al. Citation1998; Gladwin et al. Citation2012); the current study concerns widespread, population-level associations and general psychological processes rather than individual differences. However, previous research has shown relationships between what the IAT measures and self-reported behavior related to alcohol use. Risky drinking is associated with stronger associations between alcohol and approach (Palfai and Ostafin Citation2003; Ostafin and Palfai Citation2006) and weaker associations between alcohol and negative concepts (Wiers et al. Citation2002; Houben et al. Citation2009, Citation2010). Individual differences between IAT measures and attentional bias have been found, stronger alcohol-negative associations being associated with attentional avoidance of alcohol stimuli (Gladwin and Vink Citation2018).
Previous research has already shown connections between computational semantic similarity and behavioral associations. Computational similarities between words represented as word-embeddings, or vectors in language models, have been shown to mirror a range of prejudices expressed in behavioral data (Caliskan et al. Citation2017). This was noted to represent a risk in societal uses of machine learning, but also demonstrates that such meaning representations reflect psychological patterns. Going a step further, a covariation was demonstrated, over studies, between linguistic similarities between items based on co-occurrence of words in a large corpus of textual data and behavioral effects in lexical IATs (Lynott et al. Citation2012). It was noted that multiple causal interpretations of such findings are currently possible. Nevertheless, if a strong empirical foundation can be established that shows that behavioral data can be explained by semantic models, then connecting computational models to implicit measures could progress our theoretical understanding of the nature of ‘associations’ in implicit biases.
The current study aims to continue this line of inquiry in the alcohol context, by testing at the item level whether alcohol-related associations measured via the IAT are related to variations in NNLM-based semantic similarities involving specific words in IATs. The data used for this concerned IAT-derived alcohol-valence associations. This particular dataset involved two variants of the IAT, one of which assessed alcohol-related associations with positive stimuli, for example, ‘Social’, ‘Exciting’, and ‘Acceptance’, and one with negative stimuli, for example, ‘Violent’, ‘Disapproval’, and ‘Failure’ (Gladwin and Vink Citation2018). The hypothesis was that item-specific congruence effects on behavioral performance measures would be associated with the computed relative similarity of the valence items with the sets of alcohol versus non-alcohol stimuli.
Methods
The data and source code used in the analyses are available at https://figshare.com/s/835d5be0307f69fbe7c4.
Psychological data and score calculation
The behavioral data came from a previously published study, where task details and results are available (Gladwin and Vink Citation2018). The data that could be used for the current analyses consisted of 75 participants, one of which was rejected in quality checks for extremely low accuracy, leaving 74 participants. We briefly repeat the task description for convenience here. A variant of the IAT was used in which there was one contrasting pair of categories - alcoholic versus nonalcoholic - but a single valence category. This version of the IAT has the form of a ‘single-target’ IAT, STIAT (Dickson et al. Citation2013), where in this case the ‘target’ is the valence. Two different STIATs were used: one had the valence category ‘positive’, the other ‘negative’; in both cases, the stimuli were chosen to be theoretically associated with alcohol. Positive words were: ‘Confident’, ‘Social’, ‘Exciting’, ‘Relaxing’, ‘Acceptance’, ‘Worthwhile’, and ‘Success’. Negative words were ‘Dangerous’, ‘Violent’, ‘Boring’, ‘Disgusting’, ‘Disapproval’, ‘Hangover’, and ‘Failure’. In both task versions, alcohol words were the beverages (familiar to the study population) ‘Beer’, ‘Wine’, ‘Heineken’, ‘Amstel’, ‘Grolsch’, ‘Whiskey’, and ‘Gin’; and nonalcohol words were the beverages ‘Juice’, ‘Tea’, ‘Coffee’, ‘Water’, ‘Cassis’, ‘Milk’, and ‘Cola’. (In the original study, the separate STIATS were used to allow the assessment of potential simultaneous positive and negative associations with alcohol versus non-alcohol.) Critically, blocks in the STIAT vary in the mapping of categories to response buttons. Alcohol and non-alcohol stimuli always required responses using opposite buttons. On congruent blocks, the valence category was mapped to the alcohol key; on incongruent blocks, the valence category was mapped to the non-alcohol key. Congruence thus refers to the assumed association between alcoholic, relative to nonalcoholic, drinks and the positive or negative concepts.
The behavioral measures of association between alcohol versus nonalcohol and the respective valences were (1) the difference in reaction time (RT) on accurate trials and (2) the difference in accuracy, between congruent and incongruent blocks when responding to valence words. That is, for example, if there is an automatic association between alcohol and positive, participants should be faster and more accurate to respond to the word ‘Confident’ when it is mapped to the Alcohol response button than when it is mapped to the Nonalcohol response button. Behavioral performance measures were derived only from valence words as these were always associated with a shared response button, whereas the change in mapping from congruent to incongruent blocks for alcohol and nonalcohol words was confounded with a shift from being the only category mapped to one button to sharing a response button. For the current study, for each valence word the difference, for reaction time and accuracy, between responses in congruent and incongruent blocks were calculated, per participant. The median reaction time over trials and the mean accuracy over trials were used. A negative score for RT means that responses were faster in the congruent block and a positive score for accuracy means that responses were more accurate in the congruent block.
Modeling of semantic associations
The basis of the quantification of semantic associations was the word2vec algorithm (Mikolov, Chen, et al. Citation2013; Mikolov, Sutskever, et al. Citation2013). This algorithm uses the interrelationship between words in a large corpus of sentences to represent words as a 300-dimensional vector. In the current analyses, the GenSim library was used (Řehůřek and Sojka Citation2010), with word vectors based on the Google News corpus, GoogleNews-vectors-negative300. The cosine similarity between word2vec vectors was used a measure of similarity between a given pair of words.
These similarities were used to calculate an alcohol-association score between each individual valence word and the sets of words of the alcohol and nonalcohol stimulus sets. For a given valence word (e.g. ‘Exciting’), the score was calculated as its mean similarity with the set of alcohol words minus its mean similarity with the set of non-alcohol words. The similarity scores were, for the positive words: ‘confident’: .0082, ‘social’: −.0082, ‘exciting’: .028, ‘relaxing’: .013, ‘acceptance’: −.0051, ‘worthwhile’: .0028, ‘success’: .0058; and for the negative words: ‘dangerous’: −.030, ‘violent’: .0078, ‘boring’: −.030, ‘disgusting’: −.0067, ‘disapproval’: −.025, ‘hangover’: .033, ‘failure’: −.046.
Preprocessing
The z-score of all reaction time difference scores, over all participants and all words, was calculated. Reaction times with an absolute z-score over four were considered outliers and removed. It was also checked, per participant, whether at least three words within a task and block type had a valid RT difference score (i.e. at least one accurate trial, that was not an outlier) and whether the overall accuracy was at least .5. The resulted in one participant being rejected. We acknowledge that this procedure differs from that often used in traditional IAT analyses.
Statistical tests of relationships between behavioral and computational associations
The statistical tests were performed for the positive and the negative task variants separately, and for RT and accuracy separately. Per task and for RT and accuracy, within each participant, the covariance between the valence words’ behavioral and computational association score was calculated as that participant’s behavioral-computational association score. A one-sample t-test was performed to determine whether the mean of these per-subject covariances was significantly non-zero. That is: is there, over all participants, a consistent direction of a measure of their within-subject association between their behavioral and computational association scores?
Results
The mean reaction times were, for the positive task, 648 (SD = 130) ms on incongruent blocks and 668 (SD = 148) ms on congruent blocks; and for the negative task, 681 (SD = 115) ms on incongruent blocks and 654 (SD = 112) ms on congruent blocks. The mean accuracies were, for the positive task, .91 (SD = .096) on incongruent blocks and .85 (SD = .12) on congruent blocks; and for the negative task, .86 (SD .12) on incongruent blocks and .91 (.093) on congruent blocks. For the positive task, a within-subject effect of block type indicating a reversed association between alcohol and positive concepts was found for accuracy (t(73) = −4.09, p = .0001), but no effect was found for RT (t(73) = 0.51, p = .61). For the negative task, a within-subject effect of block type indicating an association between alcohol and negative concepts was found for accuracy (t(73) = 2.74, p = .0077) and RT (t(73) = −2.51, p = .01). We briefly note that in the prior findings (Gladwin and Vink Citation2018), a number of associations were found between the behavioral data and questionnaire scales concerning risky drinking, social drinking motives, and enhancement drinking motives, as well as with attentional bias measures.
The relationships between computational and behavioral associations scores are shown in
. For the alcohol-positive task, there was a significant association between computational and behavioral association scores for RT (mean = −0.29, t(73) = −2.03, p = .046): that is, items with stronger computational associations with alcohol had stronger congruence effects, that is, faster reaction times on congruent versus incongruent blocks. There was no association for accuracy (mean = −0.00, t(73) = −1.46, p = .15).

Discussion
The current study aimed to determine whether variations in computational similarity, based on a NNLM, is associated with behavioral effects of congruence versus incongruence. This was indeed found to be the case in two Implicit Association Test variants involving alcohol-related associations. Items with stronger computational associations with alcohol also had stronger behavioral congruence effects, for alcohol-positive as well as alcohol-negative associations. The results suggest some interesting directions for theory and methods.
From the perspective of the features of NNLM and the word2vec algorithm, the current results provide further evidence that such methods capture at least some aspects of the kind of psychological processing involved in implicit measures. This empirically extends knowledge on the method’s ability to usefully quantify meaning to the domain of dual process models of automatic versus reflective cognitive processing (Schneider and Shiffrin Citation1977; Bargh Citation1994; Deutsch and Strack Citation2006). The model could thus conceivably be used to support a range of applications involving ‘nudging’ or cognitive bias modification (MacLeod Citation2012; Gladwin et al. Citation2016). Such interventions aim to influence behavior via inducing changes in automatic processes; for instance, approach-avoidance retraining for alcoholism has been shown to reduce the chances of relapse (Wiers et al. Citation2011; Eberl et al. Citation2013; Rinck et al. Citation2018), with statistical mediation via implicit measures (Eberl et al. Citation2013; Gladwin et al. Citation2015). Where interventions involve verbal stimuli, in communications or as stimuli in training paradigms, stimulus selection could leverage semantic similarities to optimize the desired associations.
Conversely, from the perspective of theories of automatic associations, the results may provide a stepping stone to more precise, computational models of associations in human cognition. While the claim here is of course not that the current results imply that the brain implements any particular specific algorithm, and the relationship between corpora-based linguistic models and cognition is complex (Wingfield and Connell Citation2019), using a semantic model provisionally may generate more specific hypotheses than very general concepts of associations. That is, rather than visualizing an association as two circles connected by a line, where the circles represent words and the line represents their association, an association becomes a relatively similar pattern of weights in a neural network layer following a certain kind of training. Whether the brain could implement such training in an analogous way is a question for further computational neuroscientific research, although we note that there certainly exists promising research into neurally plausible analogues for computational neural networks (Suri and Schultz Citation1999; Jocham et al. Citation2011; Hao et al. Citation2020).
Such modeling of semantic relationships also serves to emphasize the fundamental question of the relationship between task-specific processes involving verbal stimuli and putatively-related automatic processes underlying behavior (Lynott et al. Citation2012). In the context of alcohol use, drinking behavior and experiences may affect the meaning assigned to certain stimuli and the words associated with them; for example, for a social drinker, the feature of a drink or situation being alcohol-related could imply it acquires the meaning of enjoyable, friendly, and so on. For coping drinking, the meaning of alcoholic could include a reduction in stress. Our models of such associations in meaning in this broader psychological sense could be analogous to semantic vectors, except for being acquired from learning experiences rather than a corpus of texts. The reinforcing effects of alcohol could then play a role in biasing the acquisition of alcohol-related meanings (Robinson and Berridge Citation1993; Gladwin and Wiers Citation2012).
It must be acknowledged and emphasized that such generalizations from the linguistic to the psychological context are speculative and the current study provides only a step toward lines of research in such directions. However, there is a natural hypothetical causal mechanism connecting semantics and emotional states, namely appraisal ( Hajcak and Nieuwenhuis Citation2006; Cutuli Citation2014; Bayliss et al. Citation2017). If meaning is biased in a certain way, this could affect the appraisal of stimuli and hence emotional responses. Further, verbal stimuli are psychologically associated with other cognitive and emotional processes (Stanford et al. Citation2001; Cane et al. Citation2009; Frings et al. Citation2010; Herbert and Kissler Citation2010; Ashley et al. Citation2013), and so semantic associations could form a bridge between more general stimuli and psychological states. Finally, we note that semantic models may fit into different models of the IAT, such as the quad model (Conrey et al. Citation2005; Beer et al. Citation2008). The quad model notes that the IAT is not a process-pure task and attempts to disentangle four sub-processes, and has been used to attempt to better understand relationships between alcohol and aggression (Gladwin et al. Citation2018). One of the sub-processes is the automatic activation of an association. In the quad model, this is not further formalized beyond the role of the parameter in a multinomial model fitting performance data. It seems that computational models of semantic similarities could be, at least conceptually, plugged in to the model within this parameter.
The results also suggest a use of machine learning in improving implicit measures. One of the issues with implicit methods is the variation in effects from trial to trial due to which specific stimuli are used. Considering the specific stimuli used in the tasks has been found to improve psychometric properties; for instance, internal reliability of an attentional bias measure involving alcohol was improved by using personalized stimuli (Christiansen et al. Citation2015). Exploratory research found that only certain stimulus categories showed mediating mechanisms of a cognitive training intervention for alcoholism (Gladwin et al. Citation2015). At the item level of the IAT, certain words chosen to fit in a category could have stronger congruence effects than others. Using algorithms such as those used in the current study would allow researchers to use the strategy of selecting word sets based on a priori computational similarities that are more likely to result in sensitive methods able to detect effects of interest; or word sets with less strong overall similarities that could be more suitable to evoke individual differences (Hedge et al. Citation2018). Furthermore, this approach would allow a principled re-analysis of existing data that could focus on subsets of stimuli predicted to be more able to evoke effects.
The current study provides an initial step in this direction but, of course, has limitations. The current results concern specific alcohol-related associations, with certain sets of positive and negative stimuli. Future research is needed to determine whether the connection between computational and behavioral measures of association generalizes. Further, the original study (Gladwin and Vink Citation2018) concerned a convenience sample, which was considered appropriate to the aims but did not allow strong inferences concerning populations within which effects would or would not be expected; future research could focus on more specific populations and potential differences between them. Similarly, the corpus on which the word vectors used in the current study were based involved only one particular, although well-known, vocabulary; other corpuses could in principle generate models with different results. Finally, we did not compare different types of models: while the current results showed strong associations involving computational and behavioral similarities at item level, future research might find different models that are even better at predicting behavioral patterns.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrated relationships, at the item level, between computational measures of association, based on quantified semantic similarity, and behavioral measures of association, based on reaction time in Implicit Association Tests. The results add to the evidence that neural network language models and the word2vec algorithm captures interesting aspects of meaning, may support theoretical development around implicit associations, and provides directions for methodological improvements in implicit measures design and data (re-)analysis.

Concerns have been raised about the low reliability of measurements of spatial attentional bias via RT differences in dot-probe tasks. The anticipatory form of the bias, directed towards predicted future stimuli, appears to have relatively good reliability, reaching around 0.70. However, studies thus far have not attempted to experimentally control task-related influence on bias, which could further improve reliability. Evoking top-down versus bottom-up conflict may furthermore reveal associations with individual differences related to mental health. In the current study, a sample of 143 participants performed a predictive Visual Probe Task (predVPT) with angry and neutral face stimuli online. In this task, an automatic bias is induced via visually neutral cues that predict the location of an upcoming angry face. A task-relevant bias was induced via blockwise shifts in the likely location of target stimuli. The bias score resulting from these factors was calculated as RTs to target stimuli at locations of predicted but not actually presented angry versus neutral faces. Correlations were tested with anxiety, depression, self-esteem and aggression scales. An overall bias towards threat was found with a split-half reliability of 0.90, and 0.89 after outlier removal. Avoidance of threat in blocks with a task-relevant bias away from threat was correlated with anxiety, with correction for multiple testing. The same relationship was nominally significant for depression and low self-esteem. In conclusion, we showed high reliability of spatial attentional bias that was related to anxiety.

When confronted with multiple stimuli that could evoke a response, but to which only some can be responded at a time, selective attention is required to select particular stimuli for further processing (Carrasco, 2011). This kind of attention can be modelled in computational terms using saliency maps (Soltani & Koch, 2010; Treue, 2003). Salience is determined by interactions between endogenous attention, i.e., voluntary, controlled, goal-dependent “top-down” attentional processes, and exogenous attention, i.e., reflexive, automatic, stimulus-driven “bottom-up” attentional processes (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002; Posner, 1980; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Van der Stigchel et al., 2009). Importantly, automatic influences on attention have been expanded from basic visual stimulus features to include emotional or motivational features (Cisler & Koster, 2010; Niu et al., 2012). For example, stimuli with high relevance for survival such as snakes or spiders attract visual attention more than neutral stimuli such as flowers or mushrooms (Mogg & Bradley, 2006; Öhman et al., 2001; Rinck & Becker, 2006); positive stimuli also attract visual attention more than neutral stimuli, although possibly to a lesser extent than negative stimuli (Stefanics et al., 2012). Emotion-related biases in spatial attention allocation are commonly assessed by the dot-probe task (MacLeod et al., 1986; Mogg & Bradley, 1999). The dot-probe task is a two-choice decision task in which spatial attention is hypothesized to be automatically shifted by pairs of salient and neutral task-irrelevant probes that alter the reaction time to task-relevant stimuli. Probe stimuli are presented at the locations of either the salient or the neutral cue stimuli. The reaction time difference between the probe-on-salient trials and probe-on-neutral trials provides a quantification of attentional bias towards or away from the salient cue stimuli. Attentional bias towards or away from salient cues have been linked to an array of mental health problems (Cisler & Koster, 2010; Dalgleish et al., 2010). For example, bias towards threat is associated with anxiety disorders (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Cisler & Koster, 2010), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Naim et al., 2014), bias towards negative information is related to depression (Peckham et al., 2010), bias towards rejection predicts self-esteem vulnerabilities (Ravary & Baldwin, 2018), bias towards social threat is linked to hostile intent attribution in children (Miller & Johnston, 2019), and a bias towards aggression-related cues was observed in a sample of intimate partner aggression perpetrators with problematic alcohol use (Massa et al., 2019). Positive visual attentional bias has been shown to aid emotion regulation in stressful situations (Wadlinger & Isaacowitz, 2008). However, it is statistically necessary for the detection of relationships involving individual differences that the used measures are reliable, and recent studies have shown that the dot-probe task has very poor reliability (e.g., Ataya et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2014; Chapman et al., 2019; Cooper et al., 2011; Dear et al., 2011; Kappenman et al., 2014; Waechter & Stolz, 2015). Further, clinically anxious individuals were not found to have the expected bias towards threat in a meta-analysis of baseline measurements in studies aimed at tests of Attentional Bias Modification (Kruijt et al., 2019). It is thus uncertain which of the many interesting, sometimes complex results in the dot-probe literature reflect true effects, as it seems likely at least some proportion must involve false positives given a noisy bias measure. Results may need to be (re-)gathered using attentional bias measures with improved psychometric properties for the field to move forward.
The predictive version of the Visual Probe Task, predVPT (Gladwin, 2016; Gladwin & Vink, 2018), may aid in this endeavour; the task was originally termed the “cued” VPT, cVPT, which has previously been suggested to be changed to the conceptually clearer term used here (Gladwin & Vink, 2020). The task was originally designed to help measure attentional bias variability by removing undesirable sources of trial-to-trial variability, but this removal of noise may also improve split-half reliability. During the predVPT, pictorial and probe trials are selected at random throughout the task (Fig. 1). In the pictorial trials, two visually neutral predictive cues consistently predict the locations of subsequent salient and control stimuli (e.g., angry vs neutral facial expressions). This is intended to evoke automatic anticipatory processing that can bias spatial selective attention. The bias is assessed by the performance on probe trials. During these trials the predictor stimuli are presented but, instead of the pictorial stimuli, a probe consisting of a target and a distractor stimulus is presented that requires a response. The bias is thus assessed by RTs to targets at the location of predicted, but not actually presented, salient versus control stimuli. This avoids the bias on a given trial being dependent on the particular pair of stimuli selected from the salient and control categories – a participant may well have varying responses to particular exemplars, resulting in noisy data. Threat-related bias measures via the predVPT indeed showed relatively good split-half reliability compared to an equivalent dot-probe task (Gladwin, Möbius, Mcloughlin, & Tyndall, 2019); when the task design was optimized and trial numbers were increased, reliability reached psychometrically adequate levels for both threat-related bias, 0.70 (Gladwin & Vink, 2020) and alcohol-related bias, 0.74 (Gladwin, 2019). Further studies addressed the concern that systematic between-subject variance associated with individual differences related to the visual characteristics of the predictive cues might account for the high reliability (Gladwin et al., 2020; Gladwin, Figner, & Vink, 2019). An attentional bias modification training study using a training variant of the predVPT supported the interpretation that the bias involved anticipatory processes rather than merely conditioning of the initially neutral cues (Gladwin, Möbius, & Becker, 2019).

We note that the idea of an “anticipatory bias”, which does not depend on the kind of stimulus-evoked response the traditional dot-probe task aims to measure, could perhaps be considered a theoretical oxymoron in terms of traditional dual-process models. We therefore briefly provide the rationale of this approach here. As more extensively discussed elsewhere, the core feature of these models is a controlled/reflective versus automatic/impulsive distinction (Diederich & Zhao, 2019; Kahneman, 2003; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Strack & Deutsch, 2004), related to the intuitive sense that some parts of ourselves feel like they need to be kept under control, and other parts of ourselves need to do the controlling. Dual-process models describe this division in terms of the types of processing done by a reflective system versus an impulsive system. The reflective system consists of high-level cognitive functions that allow flexible, complex cognition and self-control, at the cost of being slow, effortful and error-prone; for instance, the manipulation of information in working memory, or the inhibition of a prepotent response. The impulsive system consists of lower-level functions that are simpler but fast, relying on previous learning experiences resulting in simple associations or immediate, “hard-wired” emotional responses; for instance, the quick classification of a half-seen shape as a spider or avoidance of painful stimuli. Although these models are very widely used, the claim that there is evidence for distinct systems or clearly separated sets of processes has been strongly criticized, as has the precision and adequacy of their theoretical constructs and terminology (Bellini-Leite, 2017; Gigerenzer & Regier, 1996; Grayot, 2020; Keren, 2013; Keren & Schul, 2009; Kruglanski & Gigerenzer, 2011; Osman, 2004). In response to this, a variation of dual-process models was developed, the Reprocessing and Reinforcement model of Reflectivity, the R3 model (Gladwin et al., 2011; Gladwin & Figner, 2014; Wiers et al., 2013). This was a proof-of-principle redefinition of reflective versus automatic processing defined in terms of a response evaluation and selection cycle involving predicted outcomes, in which responses can include any kind of cognitive function (Dehaene & Changeux, 2000; Samejima et al., 2005; Samejima & Doya, 2007). A response evaluation and selection cycle can involve potentially multiple iterations of searching for and evaluating responses (Cunningham et al., 2007), which would strongly depend on temporal dynamics related to strengths of previously learned associations (de Wit & Dickinson, 2009; Dickinson & Balleine, 1995). A relatively reflective versus impulsive state of processing in this model means that a relatively large amount of reprocessing is allowed for response evaluation and selection. This model explicitly merely draws together strands of existing knowledge and ideas, e.g., from cognitive neuroscience (Bunge, 2004) and neo-behaviorism (Day, 1969; Moore, 1996), that were considered to be especially relevant for the evolution of dual-process models. In so doing the model emphasizes four conceptual points: first, “top-down” processes inherently depend on emotional and motivational processes that determine the goals such processes are used to achieve (Pessoa, 2009), and therefore these processes cannot be separated into separate systems; second, it is essential to avoid category mistakes by defining concepts at the correct level of emergence, in particular by distinguishing the more holistic state of reflectivity from specific component processes, any of which ultimately consists of obviously “automatic” information processing at the neural level; third, that “control” can be a consequence of a parameter of a system, in particular time allotted to search, rather than necessitating a separate system (Kruglanski & Gigerenzer, 2011); and fourth, that executive functions, complex cognition and reflectivity are at least in part a consequence of reinforcement and learning history, in the same way as other behaviours (Day, 1969; Diamond et al., 2007; Hazy et al., 2007; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Park et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2018), rather than a kind of “mental strength” or resource. While some views of dual-process models may consider automatic processes to be stimulus-driven and non-goal-directed by definition, the R3 model thus allows for a wide range of ways in which asymmetries in cognitive processes could bias the outcome of (cognitive) response selection. In particular, if the predicted outcome of shifting attention to one or another location is more versus less attractive or aversive, this could involuntarily affect the response selection process. The predVPT was generated from, and derives its rationale from, this theoretical framework.
While the results of the predVPT are promising, previous studies have failed to control a particular task factor that may limit reliability and the ability to detect relationships with mental health: There has not been any attempt to experimentally control task-dependent influences on attention. In the traditional dot-probe task, there is no clear advantage or disadvantage to shifting attention towards or away from any given stimulus category. It is possible that associations between threat-related bias and individual difference variables will only reveal themselves when there is a particular relationship, e.g., conflict, between task-relevant versus automatic processes effects on attention. The present study therefore manipulated conflict between task-irrelevant emotional bias and the optimal direction of attention required by the task. The aim was to test whether this manipulation would (1) further improve the reliability of the predVPT, as the task-related component of attention would now be balanced rather than free to fluctuate per participant and (2) reveal, in exploratory analyses, associations with mental health-related individual differences in anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and aggression.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The sample consisted of 146 healthy adult participants who enrolled for credit or a small monetary reward. Three participants were removed for having a low overall accuracy, below 0.8. In the sample for analysis there remained 98 female and 45 male participants, mean age 25, SD = 8.8.
2.2. Materials
2.2.1. Predictive Visual Probe Task (predVPT)
The predVPT was programmed using JavaScript, PHP and HTML, and had the same trial structure as in previous work (Gladwin & Vink, 2020). There were two trial types, randomly selected per trial: Picture and Probe trials. Both trial types started with 150, 200, or 250 ms (randomly selected with equal probability) of a fixation cross. Then predictive cues were presented for 400 ms, which were the symbols OOOOO and XXXXX. One of these (randomized per participant) was coloured yellow (RGB values 250, 250, 10) and the other light blue (RGB values 10, 250, 250). The cues were placed either in the top-left and bottom-right quadrant of the screen (one cue at each position, at random), or on the bottom-left and top-right quadrant of the screen; the used quadrants alternated per trial. From this point on, the two trial types diverged. On Picture trials, one of the cues was replaced by an angry face, and the other by a neutral face; which cue was followed by which expression was consistent within each participant and randomized over participants. Faces were drawn from 36 faces of the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces set (Lundqvist et al., 1988). Pictures were shown for 1000 ms. Trials ended with an inter-trial interval of 200 ms during which the screen was empty. On Probe trials, probe stimuli were presented instead of pictures. One probe was a target, >><<, the other a distractor, /\/\ or \/\/. The task was to indicate the location of the target by pressing the key associated with its location: R for top-left, F for bottom-left, J for bottom-right, and I for top-right. The fingers used were the index (bottom positions) and middle (top positions) finger of the left and right hands. Participants had a 1000 ms response window, which was ended by a response. Incorrect responses were followed by the text “Incorrect!” in red for 200 ms; if no response was provided in time the text “Too late!” was presented in the same way; accurate responses were followed by a 200 ms blank screen.
The difference with previous studies with this task was the manipulation of the probability of the target's location relative to cue locations, which differed between even and odd blocks (randomized per participant). On one set of blocks, towards-threat blocks, there was a 90% chance the target would appear at the location of the threat-predicting cue and 10% it would appear at the location of the non-threat-predicting cue. On the other set of blocks, away-from-threat, these probabilities were reversed. These probabilities were used to experimentally induce a task-related bias towards or away from threat, in addition to any automatic, task-unrelated bias involving threat.
2.2.2. Questionnaires
The 4-question Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ4 (Kroenke et al., 2009), was used to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. Cronbach's alpha was 0.74 for anxiety and 0.74 for depression. Self-esteem was measured via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, RSES (Rosenberg, 1965). Cronbach's alpha was 0.90. The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, BP (Buss & Perry, 1992), was used to measure Physical Aggression (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86), Verbal Aggression (0.83), Hostility (0.86), and Anger (0.87).
2.3. Procedure
The experiment was performed online. Participants first completed the questionnaires, followed by two training runs of the predVPT (each two blocks of 48 trials) and then the assessment run of the predVPT (16 blocks of 48 trials). Following each run, participants were given awareness checks in which they were asked which of the cues was followed by the angry face.
2.4. Preprocessing and statistical analysis
During preprocessing of the assessment run used for analyses, the following trials were removed: The first four trials of the run, the first trial per block, error trials, trials following an error, and trials with an RT more than 3 SD away from the mean of the experimental condition the trial was in. Of the remaining probe trials, the median RT per condition was used for further analyses. These preprocessing steps were the same as those used in recent similar studies on the predVPT (Gladwin, Banic, Figner, & Vink, 2019; Gladwin & Vink, 2020).
The following analyses were performed for RT in Matlab (The Mathworks, 2015). Within-subject effects of block type (towards-threat and away-from-threat) and probe location (threat versus non-threat) were tested using the teg_RMA repeated measures ANOVA toolbox (Gladwin, 2020). These tests were also performed for accuracy. Split-half reliability was calculated using Spearman-Brown correction for the Spearman correlations between the bias on even and odd trials; bias was calculated per participant as the RT-difference between probe trials when the probe appeared at the threat minus the non-threat cue location. This means that a more negative bias score represents a stronger attentional bias towards the threat-related location. The bias was calculated over all blocks and per block type, and additionally the contrast score (bias for towards-threat blocks) – (bias for away-from-threat blocks) was calculated. Spearman correlations were used to test associations between this set of bias measures and the set of self-report measures (anxiety, depression, self-esteem, physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility). Multiple correction was performed over the tested correlations using permutation testing. This provided two approaches to controlling false positives. First, a permutation-based estimate was acquired of the p-value criterion needed for a familywise error rate of 5%. The set of bias scores were randomly permuted and then correlated with the set of self-report measures. For each of 25,000 iterations, the smallest of the p-values of the correlations of the permuted data set was stored, leading to a null-hypothesis distribution of minimum p-values. The 5th percentile of these values was used as the p-criterion with familywise error correction, as fewer than 5% of random samples would have any test with a p-value below this value. Note that due to the exploitation of dependence between variables in the permutation procedure, this approach can result in less loss of power than Bonferroni correction. Second, using the same permutation procedure, we tested the significance of the number of nominally significant correlations (p < .05), as in previous work (Gladwin & Vink, 2018). This allows detection of effects at the level of the set of tests, trading off specificity for power: tests do not need to achieve very low p-values, but we cannot claim that any particular test achieved familywise corrected significance as with the permutation-based familywise error correction.

Note. Table 1A shows descriptive statistics for the scales of the self-report measures and the accuracy for the three awareness checks asking about which cue predicted the location of threat stimuli. Table 1B shows performance data for the predVPT task: the mean (over participants) of the median (over trials) RT and mean accuracy per condition. Non-threat and threat refer to whether the probe appeared at the location of a cue predicting non-threat or threat pictures. Away and Towards refer to block type: Is the experimentally induced task-related bias (based on the block's probe-location probability) towards or away from the threat location?
Significant within-subject effects on RT were found for probe location, F(1, 142) = 10.15, p = .0018, eta_p^2 = 0.067, and for the interaction between probe location and block type, F(1, 142) = 52.65, p < .0001, eta_p^2 = 0.27. The interaction reflects the experimental induction of a task-induced bias due to the likely target location on the current block. The main effect of probe location represented a bias towards the threat location (513 ms versus 523 ms) over both block types.
The reliability of bias scores was high for the overall bias, 0.90. The reliability of the bias separated per block type was 0.59 for away-from-threat blocks and 0.73 for towards-threat blocks. The reliability of the contrast between the bias in the two block types was 0.50. The high reliability of 0.90 for the overall bias was explored further to check for effects of outliers (although the use of Spearman's rather than Pearson correlation would have reduced their influence). On visual inspection a clear outlier was found with unusually large bias scores, but removal of this datapoint hardly changed the reliability, which become 0.89 (Fig. 2).

A list of all pairwise correlations between all variables is provided in Supplementary material. The permutation procedure provided a p-value criterion of 0.0086 for familywise error correction. Two correlations were significant at this level: the overall bias and anxiety, r = 0.23, p = .0053, and the bias in away-from-threat blocks and anxiety, r = 0.25, p = .0024. The number of nominally significant tests was also significant; there were 4 significant tests, p = .0071, consisting of the two correlations involving anxiety, and further those between the bias in away-from-threat blocks and depression, r = 0.21, p = .013, and the bias in away-from-threat blocks and self-esteem, r = −0.18, p = .027. Taken together, the results suggest that increased anxiety, increased depression, and lower self-esteem were all related to a tendency to avoid upcoming threat when this was in line with task-relevant contingencies; with the evidence being strongest for anxiety.
4. Discussion
The current study used a version of the predVPT in which the relationship between an emotion-related attentional bias and a task-related attentional bias was manipulated. This was expected to improve reliability by controlling the degree to which participants might direct attention in a voluntary way. Further, relationships with individual differences in mental health-related variables were explored.
Reliability of the overall bias was high, increasing to 0.9 using the current version with improved experimental control of the task-related bias from the 0.7 previously found using the predVPT (Gladwin, 2019; Gladwin & Vink, 2020). Reliability for the bias when calculated separately for sub-conditions was lower, which is as expected given the decrease in trial numbers; however, these were still in the 0.5–0.7 range and hence relatively high compared to the very low range reported for usual measures of spatial attentional bias. The current findings on overall bias in particular thus continue the improvement of reliability of the bias, due to attention to specific task features, in this case the experimental control of the task-relevant benefits to bias in one or the other direction. With the current reliability, the bias would be an adequate measure to use in individual differences research. Notably, this was found with online data collection, which may be important in a general pragmatic sense but also in terms of equality and inclusivity as not all researchers will have easy access to labs or eye-tracking equipment.
The current results in fact included correlational effects. Using strict multiple testing correction, anxiety was associated with avoidance of the predicted threatening stimuli. This was found using the overall bias, but the effect was carried by the bias in blocks in which the task-related bias was congruent with this avoidance. It thus appears that, in the sampled population, the anxiety-related bias was obscured when the participant was using an incompatible task-relevant bias. Also within blocks with a task-relevant bias away from threat, trends were found for depression and self-esteem: depression and lower self-esteem, like anxiety, involved avoidance. While anxiety is often associated with vigilance towards threat, excessive avoidance of aversive stimuli has also been linked to mental health disorders (Dempsey et al., 2000; Lavy & van den Hout, 1994; Maia, 2010; Mogg et al., 2004; Moukheiber et al., 2010). The avoidance of predicted, rather than already presented, threatening stimuli could, speculatively, reflect a possible coping strategy used by anxious individuals. In line with such a strategy, directing visual attention away from conflicting information downregulates its salience (Wadlinger & Isaacowitz, 2008) and reduces the startle effect (Singh et al., 2020). Thus, in terms of R3-defined automaticity, the bias involves selecting an attentional response that will reduce the impact of threatening stimuli. This bias may be involved in anxiety, depression, and self-esteem, but to measure it appears to require the manipulation of the interaction between task-related and task-unrelated attentional biases.
The current study only included awareness checks concerning the consistent cue-picture mapping, which indicated that subjects strongly tended to develop awareness (possibly partly due to the checks themselves). It is therefore not known whether participants were aware of the alternating cue-probe (or predicted picture-probe) mapping. Although this novel task feature appeared to improve psychometric properties and reveal relationships with individual differences, it is uncertain how it might have changed the task and processes underlying the bias relative to previous versions of the task with random probe locations. The average bias over alternating blocks is not equivalent to the bias over blocks with no such contingency at all; for example, alternating contingencies may train participants to attend to contingencies and predictive stimuli (Gladwin, 2017). While the current rationale focused on the control of task-relevant, probe-related attentional influences, future research is needed to test hypotheses on potential mechanisms underlying the effect of this task factor. Relevant processes could include, for instance, whether conflict was evoked between the “top-down” and “bottom-up” influences on attention (i.e., the predictions of emotional pictures and of task-relevant probes and their use in response selection mechanisms), which could have influenced conflict monitoring processes relevant to effects of emotional stimuli (Bishop, 2009; Botvinick et al., 1999); differences between individuals' ability to use task-relevant predictive cues in the different block contexts; or differences related to the downregulation or inhibition of the influence of emotional stimuli (Oei et al., 2009).
Other limitations of the study include the convenience sample. Especially given the good reliability and promising correlational relationships, it would appear worth investing in studies using the predVPT in samples focusing on particular mental health issues in future research. Clear confirmatory hypotheses could be used based on the current results on anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Another limitation was the online data collections. However, it has been found that data collected online do not show extreme differences from those collected in the lab (Chetverikov & Upravitelev, 2016; Gosling & Mason, 2015; van Ballegooijen et al., 2016). It is perhaps worth noting that participant behaviour in the lab is also not always ideal, and the lab itself is an abnormal setting. Together with considerations of pragmatism, we would suggest that online data collection and behavioural measures are a valid part of a broad, coherent approach to data collection which should of course also include laboratory measurements and, e.g., eye tracking or physiological methods. Future research is also needed to assess test-retest reliability over multiple sessions, as psychological test-retest effects may lead to divergent results from the current assessment of split-half reliability. There are also many potential variations of the task, in particular the stimuli and stimulus categories and the duration of trial intervals. While the current task produced good results, future research is needed to expand knowledge of the biases found elsewhere in the feature space of the task. In particular temporal dynamics, and hence trials or blocks with varying Cue-Probe Intervals, are of interest from the R3 perspective. Finally, we note that the relationship is uncertain between effects found using the current task and the usual dot-probe task, and more broadly with other variations or alternative tasks (Grafton et al., 2021; Heitmann et al., 2021). Performance-related measures derived from broadly similar tasks do not necessarily reflect the same processes or biases, and generally have multiple potential explanations. For instance, effects on a given task may be due to an ability to disengage spatial visual attention from a salient stimulus, while on another task effects may be due to predictive processing driving attentional shifts. Research aimed at such comparisons will hopefully provide rich empirical information helpful for theoretical progress, but this will in any case require solid methodological foundations.
In conclusion, high reliability of anticipatory spatial attentional bias to threat was found when task-related attentional bias was controlled. Anxiety, and to a lesser extent depression and low self-esteem, were associated with a tendency to avoid predicted threatening stimuli. The results confirm and extend results demonstrating that high reliability of an implicit measure of spatial attentional bias can be achieved via online behavioural data collection, although this requires adjustments of traditional tasks and theoretical rationales.
